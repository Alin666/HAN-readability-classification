That is why some cities are turning empty shopping malls into schools. Stores become classrooms, and restaurants become lunchrooms. Making a mall into a school is faster and costs less than building a new school.

Measures of average - Mean from a frequency table
Sara wanted to know the ages (in whole years) of children on her school bus. She conducted a survey and her results are shown below:
To find the mean add all the ages together and divide by the total number of children.
If you type all those ages into a calculator it is highly likely that you would make a mistake or forget where you were up to.
It would be better if you could see these results displayed in a frequency table:
The frequency table shows us that there are six children aged 11, seven children aged 12, five children aged 13...etc.
To find the sum of their ages, calculate:
(6 × 11) + (7 × 12) + (5 × 13) + (7 × 14) + (3 × 15) + (2 × 16) = 390
The total number of children is 6 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 30
So the mean age is 390 ÷ 30 =
You could also write this information into the table as shown below:
Mean = 390 ÷ 30 = 13
How mean are you? Find out with this activity

Jesse Coltrane, a 15-year-old student at Camden's Promise, says that kids can help people in need through school and community projects. Like Jesse, thousands of students will be working in their schools and communities to make the world a better place during National Volunteer Week (April 27 through May 3).
This year will mark the 30th anniversary of National Volunteer Week. The theme of this year's week is ""Celebrate Volunteers-The Spirit of America."" As part of this year's week, kids across the United States will be taking part in service projects. Many kids will also participate in community events to honor volunteers.
""When you volunteer, you help America become strong. You become an instant champion!""
""Volunteers learn important skills like teamwork and responsibility,"" said Melissa Helmbrecht, founder of the volunteer organization Champions of Hope.
Champions of Hope is made up of more than 650,000 kids across the country and includes Jesse Coltrane and other students at Camden's Promise. Champions of Hope participants across the country are volunteering to collect food for the hungry, clean parks, and raise money for firefighters.
Champions of Hope started a United Day of Service on September 11, 2002, one year after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On that day,
star Sean Astin spoke to youths gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., about the importance of civic action. Astin plays hobbit Sam Gamgee in the movie. Astin told
, ""It is our responsibility to keep making the world a better place. We can do that by helping others.""
Sixth-grade student Matthew Malon from Illinois attended the September 11, 2002, rally and has collected food for homeless shelters. Astin's speech on volunteering moved him.
Some students from Camden's Promise also attended the rally. Students Damian Johnson, Keith Bennett, and Tashay Moody agree that it's important for kids to volunteer.As 16-year-old Damian Johnson puts it: ""[Volunteering] makes me feel like I have made an impact on people who don't have as much as I have.""
""How can I make a difference in the world if I'm just an ordinary kid?"" Thirteen-year-old author Sondra Clark answers that question in her fourth book,
!, which hit bookstores in March. She shows kids that small actions, such as donating videos to a children's hospital, can make a big difference.
Clark was motivated to write her book after reading an article on volunteerism in
. She has traveled to Africa to help children. Currently, she is traveling across the United States with her parents to share her experiences.
The action doesn't stop for actor Sean Astin when the cameras stop rolling. Astin, one of the stars of The Lord of the Rings movies and the father of two young children, is inspiring kids to make the world a better place.
In January, Astin was appointed to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. President George W. Bush created the council to encourage volunteerism. He has urged Americans to make a lifetime commitment to volunteering.
Astin tells kids that it's easy to make a difference. As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, he volunteered his time helping preschool students cross the street. He told Weekly Reader, ""I remember feeling that because I was helping someone, I had an incredible responsibility, and it felt great. It made me a better person.""

The graph shows percentages of people living in the U.S. from some ethnic groups. The figures add up to more than 100% because some people said they were from more than one ethnic group and were counted more than once.
Every ten years, the U.S. government counts all the people who live in the United States. The count is called the
. Recently, the government began releasing some of the information it learned from the 2000 census.
The census counted 281.4 million people in the United States. More than 72 million of those people are kids under age 18. That means that about 26 out of every 100 people are kids!
The census also showed that U.S. kids are more
diverse than ever before. That means that today's kids have ancestors who came from a greater variety of foreign countries. ""The nation is more diverse in the year 2000 than it was in 1990, when the last census was taken,"" said Jorge del Pinal of the U.S. Census Bureau.
, or people who are not part of the largest ethnic group, increased from 24 percent to 31 percent of the total U.S. population. Much of that minority increase is due to immigration to the United States, the census reported. One in five kids has at least one parent who moved to this country from another country.
Del Pinal added that kids are more diverse than their parents because the number of marriages between people of different races is four times higher than it was in 1990. Two out of every five kids are part of at least one minority group.
Nearly 3 million kids have parents who have different ethnic backgrounds. For example, one parent may be from Asia and another from Europe.

2676	5	"Plants make their own food by photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide and water react together in the presence of light and chlorophyll to make glucose and oxygen. The glucose is converted into starch, fats and oils for storage. It is used to make cellulose for cell walls, and proteins for growth and repair. It is also used by the plant to release energy by respiration.
Photosynthesis is the chemical change which happens in the leaves of green plants. It is the first step towards making food, not just for plants but ultimately every animal on the planet as well. During this reaction, carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen. The reaction requires light energy, which is absorbed by a green substance called
Photosynthesis takes place in leaf cells. These contain chloroplasts - tiny objects that contain chlorophyll.
Higher tier only for the following equation
Glucose is soluble. It is transported in the plant as soluble sugars but stored as
- which is insoluble, so it cannot escape from the cells. The stored starch can be turned back into glucose later and used to release energy by respiration. Starch and glucose can also be used by the plant to make:
fats and oils for storage by the plant
Three factors can limit the speed of photosynthesis: light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature.
Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly, even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide. Increasing the light intensity will boost the speed of photosynthesis.
Sometimes photosynthesis is limited by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. Even if there is plenty of light, a plant cannot photosynthesise if there is insufficient carbon dioxide.
If it gets too cold, the rate of photosynthesis will decrease. Plants cannot photosynthesise if it gets too hot.
If you plot the rate of photosynthesis against the levels of these three limiting factors, you get graphs like the ones above.
In practice, any one of these factors could limit the rate of photosynthesis.
Farmers can use their knowledge of these limiting factors to increase crop growth in greenhouses. They may use artificial light so that photosynthesis can continue beyond daylight hours, or in a higher-than-normal light intensity. The use of paraffin lamps inside a greenhouse increases the rate of photosynthesis because the burning paraffin produces carbon dioxide, and heat too.
Food belonging to the food group consisting of sugars, starch and cellulose. It is vital for energy in humans, and is stored as fats if eaten in excess. In plants, carbohydrates are important for photosynthesis.
produced in photosynthesis, green plants need to
to engage in respiration - the energy-producing process inside living cells
, just as animals do. Respiration takes place in the plant's cells, using oxygen to produce energy and giving off carbon dioxide as a waste product. So in terms of the gas taken in and the gas given out, respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis.
The result is that during the day when the plant is both respiring and photosynthesising there is a two-way traffic of oxygen and carbon dioxide both into and out of the plant. During the night when the plant is respiring but not photosynthesising, oxygen is being taken in but not given out - and carbon dioxide is being given out but not taken in.
Luckily, plants use up more carbon dioxide in photosynthesis than they produce in respiration, and produce more oxygen while photosynthesising than they use up while respiring - otherwise there would not be enough oxygen in the atmosphere for us animals to breathe!

the need for economic development, where standards of living improve
respect for the environment and the resources it provides for us
Recycling is an important way to help us achieve sustainable development. We can recycle many resources, including:
Glass is easily recycled. It can be melted and remoulded to make new objects, such as bottles. The energy needed to do this is less than the energy needed to make new glass from its raw materials. However, we need to sort different coloured glass ready for recycling, and transport it to the recycling plant.
Just like glass, it takes less energy to melt and remould metals than it does to extract new metals from their ores. Aluminium is a valuable metal that melts at a relatively low temperature, and is particularly attractive for recycling. However, a lot of metals that we use are mixtures called alloys, and it can be difficult to sort different metals ready for recycling.
Paper is not melted when it is recycled. Instead, it is broken up into small pieces and reformed to make new sheets of paper. This takes less energy to do than making paper from trees. However, paper can only be recycled a few times before its fibres become too short to be useful, and the recycled paper is often only good enough for toilet paper or cardboard. But it can be used as a fuel or compost instead.
from 2006 about a new school in Birmingham where most of the waste produced during its construction was recycled.

2484	5	"Infectious diseases are caused by the transmission of pathogens, which are microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. Pathogens can be transmitted by direct contact - horizontal and vertical transmission - and by indirect contact - vehicle-borne transmission and vector-borne transmission.
Pathogens are microorganisms that cause infectious disease. Bacteria and viruses are the main pathogens.
Bacteria come in many shapes and sizes, but even the largest are only 10 micrometres long (10 millionths of a metre).
Bacteria are living cells and, in favourable conditions, can multiply rapidly. Once inside the body, they release poisons or toxins that make us feel ill.
Hepatitis C virus. DNA are enclosed in a protein coat.
Viruses are many times smaller than bacteria. They are among the smallest organisms known and consist of a fragment of genetic material inside a protective protein coat.
Viruses can only reproduce inside host cells, and they damage the cell when they do this. A virus can get inside a cell and, once there, take over and make hundreds of thousands of copies of itself. Eventually the virus copies fill the whole host cell and burst it open. The viruses are then passed out in the bloodstream, the airways, or by other routes.
Microorganisms can be transmitted in two main ways: direct contact and indirect contact.
Direct contact means that the disease-causing microbe is passed from one person to another when their bodies touch in some way.
happens when microorganisms pass from a mother to her unborn baby through the placenta. German measles and HIV can pass this way.
happens when microorganisms pass from one person to another by touching, kissing or sexual intercourse.
Indirect contact happens when microorganisms are carried to a person in some way, instead of by actual body to body contact.
involves an object carrying the disease-causing microorganism.
involves an animal such as an insect. For example, malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes and plague by fleas.
Most pathogens have to get inside our body to spread infection. Once they are inside, the body provides ideal living conditions - plenty of food, water and warmth. Standing in their way is our body's immune system - the body's co-ordinated response to the invading pathogens.
The first line of defence is the body's natural barriers. These include:
Tiny hairs, which line the respiratory tract. They beat continuously to move mucus and dirt up the bronchi and trachea.
The skin covers the whole body. It protects the body from physical damage, microbe infection and dehydration. Its dry, dead outer cells are difficult for microbes to penetrate, and the sebaceous glands produce oils which help kill microbes.
The respiratory system (or gaseous exchange tract) is protected in several ways. Nasal hairs keep out dust and larger microorganisms. Sticky mucus traps dust and microbes. These are then carried away by cilia, which are tiny hairs on the cells that line the gaseous exchange tract.
Tears, saliva and mucus contain an enzyme called lysozyme. This destroys microorganisms.
If microorganisms get into the body through a cut in the skin, the most important thing is to quickly close the wound so more microorganisms cannot enter. A scab does just this. The blood contains tiny structures called platelets, and a protein called fibrin. A scab is basically platelets stuck in a fibrin mesh. The animation shows how this works.

As a wound heals, nearby blood vessels widen to allow more blood to reach the area. This causes inflammation where the damaged area becomes swollen, hot and red. White blood cells called phagocytes move into the area, and destroy bacteria by engulfing and digesting them.

Pathogens contain certain chemicals that are foreign to the body and are called antigens. White blood cells called lymphocytes carry a specific type of antibody - a protein that has a chemical 'fit' to a certain antigen. When a lymphocyte with the appropriate antibody meets a dangerous foreign body (pathogen containing antigen), the lymphocyte reproduces quickly, and makes many copies of the antibody that neutralises the pathogen.
Antibodies neutralise pathogens in a number of ways:
They bind to pathogens and damage or destroy them.
They coat pathogens, clumping them together so that they are easily ingested by
Cells, such as white blood cells, that engulfs and absorbs waste material, harmful microorganisms, or other foreign bodies in the bloodstream and tissues.
They bind to the pathogens and release chemical signals to attract more phagocytes.
Lymphocytes may also release antitoxins that stick to the appropriate toxin and stop it damaging the body.

Tuberculosis, or TB for short, is a disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The microorganisms are spread through the air in tiny droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Most people who are infected do not show any symptoms. About 10 per cent of people who are infected will go on to suffer symptoms, which include:
death (in about 50 per cent of cases)
Only infected people who show symptoms of TB can spread the microorganisms to other people.

Antiobiotics are drugs that kill bacteria or prevent them from reproducing.

This is to reduce the chance that strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will emerge.

Fred and Ginger Gall and their three sons--ages 13, 11, and 6--wrapped up their adventure in early August. Their final stop was at their home state's capitol building in St. Louis.
It took them a little more than a year to complete their journey, covering a total of 48,000 square miles. They traveled across the country in a mobile home.
Although the kids attend school in Missouri, they were home-schooled during their trip. Their parents said the trip was a chance to teach their sons about the history of the United States. As part of their schooling, the kids used their textbooks from their school.
They had many field trips to add to the mix. In addition to visiting all the capitol buildings, the family stopped at science and history museums and national parks along the way.

Energy is lost moving up in a food chain, and this limits the length of the chain - so it's more efficient to feed people with plants than with meat.
Organisms usually compete with each other for resources. The populations of predators and prey are interrelated.
A food chain shows who eats what in a particular habitat. For example, grass seed is eaten by a vole, which is eaten by a barn owl. The arrows between each item in the chain always point from the food to the feeder. This is the direction in which energy flows in the food chain.

– they all get their energy and biomass by consuming (eating) other organisms.
Most food chains are quite short, and they rarely consist of more than four steps. This is because a lot of energy is lost at each step. After about three steps, very little energy is still available for use by living organisms. This also explains why there are few organisms at the top of food chains, compared with those lower down.
The dry mass of an organism is called its

Let's look at a more complex food chain:

Oak trees are very large, but caterpillars are very small. One oak tree can feed many caterpillars, but many caterpillars are needed to feed a blue tit, and many blue tits are needed to feed a sparrow hawk. If we draw a

It is far more efficient for humans to eat cereals such as wheat and barley themselves, rather than to use the cereals to feed cattle and then to slaughter the cattle for beef.
This is because the energy in the beef has already passed through two steps by the time it gets to humans, and at each step the amount of available energy is reduced. When we eat cereals (or vegetables or fruit) the energy has only passed through one step, and there has only been

Animal (including humans) and plant organisms can only survive if they can get enough resources from their habitat, and they must compete with other organisms for these resources. If they are unsuccessful and cannot move to another habitat, they will die.
Here are some of the resources that animals compete for:
Animals may also compete for mates, so that they can reproduce.
Remember that plants make their own food, using
photosynthesis is the process where green plants use water and carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce carbohydrates (stored energy) and release oxygen (as a by-product).
, so they do not compete for food. Here are some of the things that plants
Human beings are very successful organisms. We compete with other animals and with plants all over the world. For example, our farmers compete with animals and plants for water and space, and with animals for food.

Case study 2: the Canadian lynx and snowshoe hare
is the rise and fall in numbers of Canadian lynx and its favourite prey the snowshoe hare. The two populations were estimated each year for some 75 years from the number of animals caught by fur traders. The hare population was found to rise and fall in a ten-year cycle, with that of the lynx following two years later. No other cat is so dependent on a single prey species, which is why there is such a clear pattern of interdependence between the two populations.

Talk about easy money! Students in Rome, Georgia, can now pay for cafeteria food with a touch of the finger. The Rome City School District has a new, high-tech payment system that reads students’ fingerprints instead of asking students to punch in codes or swipe their ID cards.
""The finger scan system is faster,"" Rome superintendent Gayland Cooper told
""This is the kind of thing that technology should help us with.""
Before the new system, students often lost their lunch cards or forgot their codes. In addition, the cafeteria lines moved slowly, often cutting into students’ mealtimes.
The new fingerprint scanner has sped things up. ""Our students have really enjoyed the new system,"" Narkissa Ware, principal of Anna K. Davie Elementary School, told
""When the lines move faster, the students have more time to enjoy their meal.""
Getting a student’s fingerprints into the new system takes 10 minutes. After that, the student can touch the scanner at the cashier counter. The student’s picture and account information then appear on the computer screen.
Although fingerprints are an easy way to pay for lunch, some parents aren’t happy with the new system. Some students don’t use the fingerprint scanner because their parents don’t like the idea that their children’s fingerprints are being scanned daily.
Cooper says that students still have the option of punching in their codes. He adds, however, that students’ fingerprint information is secure.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used this control room when the United States first sent humans to the moon. The room also served as the center for dozens of other space missions.
""This room was used from the Gemini missions all the way through to the space shuttle in the early 1990s,"" said NASA's Gary Kitmacher, my guide.
The Gemini missions took place in the mid-1960s. Their goal was to prepare humans to land on the moon.
My tour brought back many memories. I remember watching Neil Armstrong take ""one giant leap for mankind"" on my parent's television. In 1969, Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon.
A year later, I was glued to the television again. This time, scientists in this very room were trying to figure out how to get the astronauts of Apollo 13 back home when an oxygen tank exploded aboard their craft.
In the same building as the old Mission Control room is the new Mission Control room. Here, scientists keep tabs on the International Space Station (ISS) that orbits above Earth.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of walking on the moon. Walk-ing through Johnson Space Center--some 30 years later--is the next best thing.

Huntington’s disease is a disorder of the nervous system that is caused by a dominant allele. Cystic fibrosis is a disorder of the cell membranes caused by a recessive allele.
Some characteristics, such as eye colour and the shape of the earlobe, are controlled by a single gene. These genes may have different forms.
Different forms of the same gene are called
s (pronounced al-eels). The gene for eye colour has an allele for blue eye colour and an allele for brown eye colour.
an allele that always expresses itself whether it is partnered by a recessive allele or by another like itself
describes the variant of a gene for a particular characteristic which is masked or suppressed in the presence of the dominant variant. A recessive gene will remain dormant unless it is paired with another recessive gene
allele develops if the allele is present on
allele develops only if the allele is present on
For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant, while the allele for blue eyes is recessive. An individual who inherits one or two alleles for brown eyes will have brown eyes. An individual will only have blue eyes if they inherit two copies of the allele for blue eyes.
Individuals A and B have brown eyes - only individual C has blue eyes
Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) studied the inheritance of different characteristics in pea plants. He found that when he bred red-flowered plants with white-flowered plants, all the offspring produced red flowers. If he bred these plants with each other, most of the offspring had red flowers, but some had white. This was because the allele for red flowers is dominant, and the allele for white flowers is recessive. Genetic diagrams help to show how this works.
In a genetic diagram, you show all of the possible alleles for a particular characteristic. There will be two alleles from one parent, and two from the other parent, making four altogether. You then draw lines to show all the possible ways that these alleles could be paired in the offspring. There will be four possible ways, but some or all of them could be repeated.
A genetic diagram showing the outcome of Mendelâs first cross. All the offspring have red flowers, even though they carry the recessive allele for white flowers
In genetic diagrams, the dominant allele is shown as a capital letter, while the recessive allele is shown as a lower-case letter.
A genetic diagram showing the outcome of Mendel's second cross. Three-quarters of the offspring have red flowers and a quarter have white flowers
Huntington’s disease is an inherited disorder that affects the nervous system. It is caused by a
allele. This means it can be passed on by just one parent if they have the disorder. The genetic diagram shows how this can happen.
Genetic diagram to show the inheritance of Huntingdon's disease
Note that if you are doing the Foundation Tier paper you are expected to be able to interpret genetic diagrams. If you are doing the Higher Tier paper, you are expected to be able to draw genetic diagrams for any combination of dominant and recessive alleles.
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that affects the cell membranes, causing the production of thick and sticky mucus. It is caused by a
allele. This means that it must be inherited from both parents. The genetic diagram shows how this can happen.
Genetic diagram to show the inheritance of cystic fibrosis
Notice that the offspring with Ff are labelled 'carriers'. A carrier has one copy of the faulty allele, but does not have the disorder themselves. In this example above, both parents are carriers. They may not know they are, but there is a one in four chance of them producing a child who has cystic fibrosis. It is possible to
embryos to see if they carry alleles for genetic disorders.

In the example, one parent is a carrier, while the other does not carry the allele for cystic fibrosis. They cannot produce a child with the disorder, but they can produce children who are carriers.

229	3	"News Shorts: New Rings and Moons for Uranus
Astronomers have discovered new rings around Uranus with the Hubble Space Telescope.
Astronomers have made an out-of-this-world discovery. New images from the Hubble Space Telescope show a previously unknown pair of rings around Uranus. They also reveal two additional small moons circling the seventh planet from the sun. The latest find brings the total number of known rings to 13 and moons to 27.
A ""second ring system"" has been found circling Uranus.
It is the first time new rings have been discovered in 20 years. In 1986, the
2 spacecraft flew past Uranus and sent back thousands of images of its dazzling rings and moons. At that time,
2 found two new rings, in addition to the nine rings previously seen from Earth, along with numerous moons.
After looking at the new photographs, scientists reexamined
2’s images. The scientists spotted the new rings and new moons in the older photos. The rings are so far from Uranus that they are being called the planet’s ""second ring system.""
The newly discovered rings were probably missed earlier because of their faintness. Sometimes you find things you aren’t looking for,"" says astronomer Mark Showalter.
Uranus is one of the solar system’s giant planets made of gas, which also include Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. The planet was discovered in 1781.

2408	5	"Inter-quartile range, cumulative frequency, box and whisker plots - Higher
If you are studying the higher paper you will need to know the difference between discrete and continuous data, how to plot and interpret histograms, how to calculate inter-quartile ranges, cumulative frequency and box and whisker plots.
Raw data is the information we get when we do a survey. For example, we might have a list of heights or shoe sizes.
Data can either be discrete or continuous.
This data set shows a group of
This is called discrete data because the units of measurement (for example, CDs) cannot be split up; there is nothing between 1 CD and 2 CDs.
Shoe sizes are a classic example of
data, because sizes 39 and 40 mean something, but size 39.2, for example, does not.
The data set shows a group of
This data is called continuous because the scale of measurement - distance - has meaning at all points between the numbers given, eg we can travel a distance of 1.2 and 1.8 miles.
0.1 0.2 0.6 1.1 1.2 1.8 2.0 2.7 3.4 4.6 6.2 8.0 12.1 14.2
For each question decide whether the datat set is discrete or continuous.
The heights of pupils in class 3A.
Height is continuous. For example, a pupil could be 152.3cm.
The number of chocolates in various 500g boxes.
The number of chocolates is discrete. There would not be half chocolates in a box.
The times taken for athletes to run 100m.
Time is continuous. For example, an athlete may run 100m in 10.37 seconds.
It is often better to display data in a table. This section will look at different ways to organise data, and revise the following terms:
are the groups the data is organised into.
are the boundaries between one class and the next.
is the difference between the upper class boundary and lower class boundary.
of the class is the mean of the upper and lower class boundaries.
The table shows the number of people on 12 different buses. Discrete data is normally grouped in the following way:
From the table we can see that there were 7 buses with 7-9 people on them. But we have no way of telling
how many people were on each bus.
Now look at the class widths: they are all 3.
The midpoints of the classes are 5, 8, 11 and 14, as shown in red.
There are many ways to represent continuous data in a table.
This table showd the heights (h) of 25 people. The class widths are all 10.
The class boundaries are 120, 130, 140, 150 and 160.
The midpoints of the classes are 125, 135, 145 and 155, shown in red.
The class boundaries are 109.5, 129.5, 149.5, 169.5 and 189.5.
The midpoints of the classes are 119.5, 139.5, 159.5 and 179.5.
The class boundaries are 1.5, 4.5, 7.5, 10.5 and 14.5.
The class widths are all 3, except the last one whcih is 4.
The midpoints of the classes are 3, 6, 9 and 12.5.
This table looks very similar to the table in example 2, and you might assume that the class boundaries are 20.5, 30.5 etc - but they are not! Remember that if you are 16 now, you will be 16 right up until your 17
Therefore, the class boundaries are 21, 31, 41, 51 and 61.
The midpoints of the classes are 26, 36, 46 and 56.
The following table shows the ages of 25 children on a school bus:
If we are going to draw a histogram to represent the data, we first need to find the class boundaries. In this case they are 5, 11, 16 and 18. The class widths are therefore 6, 5 and 2.
The areas of our bars should therefore be 6, 15 and 4.
Remember that in a bar chart the height of the bar represents the frequency. It is therefore correct to label the vertical axis 'frequency'.
It would therefore be incorrect to label the vertical axis 'frequency' and the label should be '
Frequency density = frequency ÷ class width
Apply this formula to the following question.
The ages of children entering a theme park in a 1-hour period are recorded in the table:
Find the class widths and frequency densities. Then draw a histogram to represent the data.
The class boundaries are 0, 4, 11 and 19.
(remember that this is age in years):
The class widths are therefore 4, 7 and 8.
divides the data into two halves. We also know that for a set of n ordered numbers the median is the (n + 1) ÷ 2
divides the bottom half of the data into two halves, and the
also divides the upper half of the data into two halves.
Lower quartile is the (n + 1) ÷ 4
Upper quartile is the 3 (n + 1) ÷ 4
Find the median, lower quartile and upper quartile for the following data:
11, 4, 6, 8, 3, 10, 8, 10, 4, 12 and 31.
Ordering the data, we get 3, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8,10, 10, 11, 12 and 31.
The median is the (11 + 1) ÷ 2 = 6
The lower quartile is the (11 + 1) ÷ 4 = 3
The upper quartile is the 3 (11 + 1) ÷ 4 = 9
Therefore, the median is 8, the lower quartile is 4, and the upper quartile is 11.
is the difference between the upper quartile and lower quartile.
In this example, the interquartile range is 11 - 4 = 7.
A survey was carried out to find the number of pets owned by each child in a class.
The results are shown in the table:
Remember that there is a total of 31 children in the class.
Therefore, the interquartile range is 4 - 1 = 3.
Note that the interquartile range ignores extreme values. The range includes extreme values.
1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 35.
The interquartile range is 17 - 7 = 10.
The range is 35 - 1 = 34.
In cases such as these, it is often preferable to use the interquartile range when comparing the data.
The cumulative frequency is obtained by adding up the frequencies as you go along, to give a 'running total'.
The table shows the lengths (in cm) of 32 cucumbers.
Before drawing the cumulative frequency diagram, we need to work out the cumulative frequencies. This is done by adding the frequencies in turn.
22 (= 3 + 7 + 12)
28 (= 3 + 7 + 12 + 6)
32 (= 3 + 7 + 12 + 6 + 4)
The points are plotted at the upper class boundary. In this example, the upper class boundaries are 24.5, 28.5, 32.5, 36.5 and 40.5. Cumulative frequency is plotted on the vertical axis.
Cumulative frequency graphs are always plotted using the highest value in each group of data, and the cumulative frequency is always plotted up a graph, never across.
Cumulative frequency diagrams usually have this characteristic S-shape.
When looking at a cumulative frequency curve, you will need to know how to find its median, lower and upper quartiles, and the interquartile range.
of the total frequency, we can read estimates of the lower quartile, median and upper quartile from the horizontal axis.
Quartiles are associated with quarters. The interquartile range is the difference between the lower and upper quartile.
From these values, we can also estimate the interquartile range: 34 - 28 = 6
Remember to use the total frequency, not the maximum value, on the vertical axis. The values are always read from the horizontal axis.

The oldest person in Mathsminster is 90. The youngest person is 15.
The median age of the residents is 44, the lower quartile is 25, and the upper quartile is 67.
Represent this information with a box-and-whisker plot.
This table shows the number of visitors to a seaside town:

We do this by finding the average number of visitors in the four quarters of 2005:
Then we find the average number of visitors in the last three quarters of 2005 and first quarter of 2006:
Then the last two quarters of 2005 and the first two quarters of 2006:
Note that the last average we can find is for the last two quarters of 2006 and the first two quarters of 2007.
We plot the moving averages on a graph, making sure that each average is plotted at the centre of the four quarters it covers:
We can now see that there is a very slight downward trend in visitors.

2701	5	"The revolution in the textiles industry where there was a move from home-based work to factories was at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. This Revision Bite will look at some of the changes in the textiles industry.
Many historians believe that the Industrial Revolution would not have happened without the revolution in the textiles industry.
Before 1750, a lot of woollen cloth was produced, but
the textiles industry was a low-tech, labour-intensive cottage industry
. British workers were unable to spin a cotton thread strong enough to make cotton cloth, so they had to use wool thread for the warp, which
produced a half-wool, half-cotton cloth called fustian
After 1750, however, there was a revolution in the textiles industry. This involved:
, probably as a result of the growth in population, but also because of the opening up of the export market.
and innovation - the use of machinery.
, away from East Anglia and the West Country. The first factories were situated in the hills of Lancashire and Yorkshire near to fast-flowing streams, which could power the water-wheels. With the invention of the steam engine, however, factories were sited on the coalfields of the north of England and Scotland.

By 1850, Britain was ""the clothes shop of the world"". Estimated figures of output were:
In 1850, textile products made up 60 per cent of British exports.

Allowed hundreds of threads to be spun at once
. It needed a factory and a water-wheel to power it and produced a coarse strong thread that allowed British firms to make cotton cloth. Limited impact until 1785, because Arkwright had a patent and sued other manufacturers who used his idea.
Before this process was introduced, workers soaked cloth in urine or soda and left it stretched out in the sun on tenter frames for up to three months. Berthollet discovered that chlorine powder
: used rollers and a moving carriage to spin a fine, strong thread. Could be worked by women and children - cheap, unskilled labour. Had a huge impact because Crompton did not have a patent, and many manufacturers used his idea -
there were 4 million mules at work in 1811
. One result was that there was a glut of spun thread, so hand-loom weavers were able to command high wages.
Before this process was introduced, workers had decorated cloth by pressing on block-prints. Bell invented a machine for roller printing that
allowed hundreds of metres of cloth an hour to be printed in colour

it was gradually improved and thousands were used after 1825

A group of English workers who formed in the early 19th Century. They opposed and destroyed new textile machines which threatened their traditional jobs.
Eight reasons Lancashire became a cotton industry centre
- Liverpool had made millions of pounds from the slave trade, which meant there were consumers with money to buy cloth, and rich merchants with money to invest in building factories.
- the port of Liverpool allowed hundreds of tons of cotton to be imported from Egypt and America.
- the Lancashire coalfield provided coal to power the steam-engines.
- millstone grit in the Pennines meant that the water was soft, which made it easy to wash the cotton.
- the climate was damp and mild, which was necessary for spinning the cotton thread, although the mills had to be kept excessively hot and humid.
- was poor, so the people of Lancashire had more time to spend on industry.
- large numbers of women and children, pauper apprentices from the poorhouses and migrants from the countryside were prepared to work in the factories.
- up until 1774, a duty was charged on cotton cloth to protect the woollen industry. In 1774, this was abolished, and vast amounts of cotton cloth could be produced and sold at a profit.
Note that all except the first point also applied to Glasgow/Clydeside, which explains why the cotton industry was also established there.
A wig-maker who developed the water frame, although he seems to have stolen the idea from a spinner called Lewis Paul. It was too big and heavy to be used in people's homes. He moved to Nottingham to get away from the Luddism in Lancashire, went into partnership with Jedediah Strutt, and
set up a horse-powered factory in Nottingham
. At first, Arkwright sold thread to the Nottingham stocking-makers.
Strutt lent him the money to build Cromford Mill which was water-powered.
Arkwright pioneered the systems of factory rules
, discipline and time-keeping, and built the village of Cromford to house his workers.
When the duty on cotton cloth was abolished,
. He built more factories and expanded his business
Luddites burned down his factory at Chorley in Lancashire.
Arkwright sued anyone who used his idea, but

For example the formula for the neutralisation of sulfuric acid with sodium hydroxide is:
sulfuric acid + sodium hydroxide → sodium sulfate + water
By using the relative formula masses it can be calculated that 6.9g of sulfuric acid theoretically produces 10g of sodium sulfate.
If this neutralisation reaction is carried out, the actual yield is found by measuring the mass of product - sodium sulfate - that has been made. The

The difference between the theoretical yield and the actual yield for any reaction may have one or more of a number of causes:
when liquids or solids are transferred from one container to another.
If you have both the theoretical yield and actual yield, you can work out the percentage yield for the synthesis:
percentage yield = (actual yield ÷ theoretical yield) × 100
In the neutralisation of sulfuric acid with sodium hydroxide, the theoretical yield from 6.9g of sulfuric acid is 10g. In a synthesis, the actual yield is 7.2g. What is the percentage yield for this synthesis?

The solution from the burette is run into the conical flask. The solution is added one drop at a time, with swirling to mix the solutions as the end-point is approached. Eventually, a colour change shows that the correct amount has been added to react completely with the synthesised chemical in the sample.
The volume of solution added from the burette is noted. The titration results can then be used to calculate the amount of the synthesised chemical in the sample, and therefore find its purity.

Step 1: write down the balanced symbol equation
Sulfuric acid is neutralised by sodium hydroxide, to make sodium sulfate and water, according to the following equation:
Step 2: work out the relative formula mass
The relative formula masses of the reactants and products can be worked out using relative atomic masses obtained from the periodic table.
relative formula mass = (2 x 1) + 32 + (4 x 16) = 98
NaOH relative formula mass = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40
relative formula mass = (2 x 23) + 32 + (4 x 16) = 142
O relative formula mass = (2 x 1) + 16 = 18
Step 3: work out the masses of reactants and products
The masses of reactants and products can now be worked out from the equation:
98 + (2x40) = 142 + (2x18)
98 + 80 = 142 + 36
These numbers can now be applied to
- grams, kilograms, tonnes, and so on. Now try the questions below.
What mass of sulfuric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide to produce 10g of sodium sulfate?
is made from 10 x (98 ÷ 142) = 6.9g of H
What mass of sodium sulfate is made when 5.0 tonnes of sodium hydroxide is reacted with sulfuric acid?
80 tonnes of NaOH is used to make 142 tonnes of Na
5.0 tonnes of NaOH is used to make 5 x (142 ÷ 80) = 8.875 tonnes of Na

In the past, scientists estimated that the universe was between 13 and 15 billion years old. Now, thanks to satellite technology, they are able to confirm its approximate age at 13.7 billion years old-give or take 100 million years. Using satellite technology, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) created a detailed picture of what the universe would have looked like shortly after the Big Bang. The snapshot provides answers to questions about the age and origins of the universe.
""We see the results as a gold mine for learning about our universe,"" said NASA scientist Charles Bennett. ""The patterns in the picture tell us all kinds of things about the universe.""

It is very important to prepare well for this part of the examination. Give yourself plenty of practice beforehand by thinking about how you might express illness, pain, etc. and what language you would need in order to explain how you feel to someone else.
Look through past papers and you will see that the same kind of phrases come up frequently. Begin by learning these basic phrases off by heart so that you will be well equipped to make a good attempt at answering any question on health, illness, etc.
Use the warm-up exercises to help you brush up on the phrases which come up often in role plays about health.
Remember also to revise and learn by heart the vocabulary which you need for health - especially the various emotions, parts of the body and illnesses which appear very often in these situations.
In the role plays it is very important to say something for every part of each question in order to score the full marks. For example, if you are asked to make a 'coinne' (an appointment) you must mention that term, rather than just saying that you would like to see the dentist. During your preparation time, take particular care with this so that nothing gets left out when you deliver your answer.
Imagine yourself in the situation and offer appropriate information that may not be requested on the card.

A change in momentum happens when a force is applied to an object that is moving or is able to move. The total momentum in an explosion or collision stays the same.
You should know, and be able to use, the relationship between work done, force applied and distance moved.
Work and energy are measured in the same unit, the joule (J). When an object is moved by a force, energy is transferred and work is done. But work is not a form of energy - it is one of the ways in which energy can be transferred.
This equation shows the relationship between work done, force applied and distance moved:
work done (joule, J) = force (newton, N) × distance (metre, m)
The distance involved is the distance moved in the direction of the applied force.
A force of 10N is applied to a box to move it 2m along the floor. What is the work done on the box?
The work done is 10 × 2 = 20J.

Any object that is raised against the force of gravity stores
. For example, if you lift a book up onto a shelf, you have to do work against the force of gravity. The book has gained gravitational potential energy.
Elastic objects such as elastic bands and squash balls can change their shape. They can be stretched or squashed, but energy is needed to change their shape. This energy is stored in the stretched or squashed object as
(sometimes called movement energy). The more mass an object has, and the faster it is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. You should be able to discuss the transformation of kinetic energy to other forms of energy.
Several energy transfers happen when a squash ball is dropped onto a table and bounces up again.
When the ball is stationary above the table, its gravitational potential energy (GPE) is at a maximum. It has no kinetic energy (KE), or elastic potential energy (EPE).
As the ball falls, its GPE is transferred to KE and the ball accelerates towards the table.
When the ball hits the table, the KE is transferred to EPE as the ball squashes. As the ball regains its shape, the EPE is transferred to KE and it bounces upwards.
When the ball reaches the top of its travel, all the KE has been transferred to GPE again. Note that the ball will be lower than it was when it was first dropped, because some energy is also transferred as heat and sound to the surroundings.
The pendulum is a simple machine for transferring gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy, and back again.
When the bob is at the highest point of its swing, it has no kinetic energy, but its gravitational potential energy is at a maximum. As the bob swings downwards, gravitational potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy, and the bob accelerates.
At the bottom of its swing, the bob’s kinetic energy is at a maximum and its gravitational potential energy is at a minimum.
As the bob swings upwards, its kinetic energy is transferred to gravitational potential energy again. At the top of its swing, it once again has no kinetic energy, but its gravitational potential energy is at a maximum.
Note that the bob’s swing will become lower with each swing, because some energy is also transferred as heat to the surroundings.
Here is a version of the 'Work and Energy' podcast with drawings to help explain things.

. This is the tendency of the object to keep moving in the same direction. It is difficult to change the direction of movement of an object with a lot of momentum.
You can calculate momentum using this equation:
momentum (kg m/s) = mass (kg) × velocity (m/s)
magnitude - an amount because it depends on the object’s mass
direction - because it depends on the velocity of the object
What is the momentum of a 5 kg object moving at 2 m/s?
So long as no external forces are acting on the objects involved, the total momentum stays the same in explosions and collisions. We say that momentum is conserved. You can use this idea to work out the mass, velocity or momentum of an object in an explosion or collision.
A bullet with a mass of 0.03 kg leaves a gun at 1000 m/s. If the gun’s mass is 1.5 kg, what is the velocity of the recoil on the gun?
momentum of bullet = mass × velocity
Rearrange the equation: velocity = momentum ÷ mass
velocity of recoil on gun = 30 kg m/s ÷ 1.5 kg
When there is a car crash, the car, its contents, and the passengers, decelerate rapidly. They experience great forces because of the change in momentum, which can cause injury. If the time taken for the change in momentum on the body is increased, the forces on the body are reduced too. Seat belts and crumple zones are designed to reduce the forces on the body if there is a collision.
Seat belts stop you tumbling around inside the car if there is a collision. However, they are designed to stretch a bit in a collision. This increases the time taken for the body’s momentum to reach zero, so reduces the forces on it.
Air bags increase the time taken for the head’s momentum to reach zero, so reduce the forces on it. They also act a soft cushion and prevent cuts.
Crumple zones are another safety feature in cars
You should know, and be able to use, the relationship between kinetic energy, mass and speed.
This equation shows the relationship between kinetic energy (J), mass (kg) and speed (m/s):
What is the kinetic energy of a 1,000kg car travelling at 10m/s?
× 1,000 × 100 = 50,000J (or 50kJ)

You need to be able to calculate the force involved in changing the momentum of an object. Here is the equation you need:
The force is measured in newtons, N. The time is measured in seconds, s.
A 25 kg bicycle is travelling at 12 m/s. What force is needed to bring it to a halt in 5 s?
Momentum at start = 25 × 12 = 300 kg m/s
Momentum at end = 0 × 12 = 0 kg m/s
Change in momentum = 300 - 0 kg m/s
So a force of 60N is needed.
You should see that, for a given change in momentum, the longer the time taken, the smaller the force needed. This is the idea behind many car safety features. It also explains why it takes a long time to stop a super-tanker at sea, or to change its direction.

2285	5	"Earthquakes produce shock waves that cause damage. There are two types of seismic wave - p-waves and s-waves. Seismometers can detect these waves and provide evidence of the Earth’s structure.
The ozone layer reduces the amount of ultraviolet light from the Sun that reaches the Earth’s surface. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation can lead to sunburn and skin cancer, but sunblocks can reduce this damage.
Increased energy use and deforestation raise the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This leads to global warming.
The Earth’s crust and upper mantle are broken up into huge
. Where these meet, the Earth’s crust becomes unstable and earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur.
Earthquakes cause damage to buildings, and often lead to loss of life. It is difficult to predict exactly when an earthquake might happen and how bad it will be, even in places that are known for having earthquakes.
Earthquakes produce shock waves. These travel through the Earth and can be detected using a device called a
There are two types of seismic wave.
P-waves are longitudinal waves like sound waves, and s-waves are transverse waves like light waves
Ultraviolet radiation is found naturally in sunlight. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation can cause:
We cannot see or feel ultraviolet radiation, but our skin responds to it by turning darker. This happens in an attempt to reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches deeper skin tissues.
Darker skins absorb more ultraviolet light, so less ultraviolet radiation reaches the deeper tissues. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can cause normal cells to become cancerous.
Sunblocks can reduce the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation. They contain chemicals that absorb a lot of the radiation and prevent it from reaching our skin. They may also contain chemicals that reflect some of the radiation away from the skin.
Manufacturers of sunblocks make products with different sun protection
the higher the factor, the longer you can stay out in the sun without burning
high factor sunblocks reduce the risks from ultraviolet radiation more than low factor sunblocks
If, for example, you would get sunburnt after ten minutes in the sun, with Factor 5 applied you could stay in the sun for 50 minutes - or for 1500 minutes with Factor 150 applied. But the real time is usually lower, because some of the sunblock gets absorbed by the skin, and some gets rubbed off.
Dust from volcanoes reflects heat radiation from the Sun, leading to cooling. But dust from factories reflects heat radiation from cities, stopping it from escaping. This leads to warming in urban areas.
. It absorbs heat energy that is radiated from the Earth’s surface and prevents it from escaping into space. This keeps the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be. But human activities are increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This increases the
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th century
The temperature of the earth has risen over the years
Human activities leading to global warming include:
Most of the energy we use comes from burning fossil fuels. These release carbon dioxide when they burn. So the increasing use of energy is leading to increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
When land is cleared for timber and farms, there are fewer trees to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Also, if the fallen trees are burned or left to rot, additional carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere.
A knowledge of how seismic waves travel through the Earth provides us with evidence of the Earth’s structure. Remember that:
p-waves travel through solids and liquids, so they can travel through all of the Earth’s layers
s-waves cannot travel through liquid rock, so they cannot travel through the outer core
The speed of p-waves and s-waves increases as they travel deeper into the mantle. They travel through the Earth in curved paths, but they change direction suddenly when they pass through the boundary between substances in different states. The diagrams show what happens when p-waves and s-waves pass through the Earth:
S-waves cannot pass through the liquid outer core, but p-waves can. When p-waves pass from solid to liquid, then from liquid to solid, there are sudden changes in direction.

129	3	"An ancient mystery lurks beneath the coffin of King Tutankhamen (too-tahng-KAH-men). Researchers are trying to determine whether a horrible crime thousands of years ago led to the young Egyptian king's death. Did someone murder a boy called King Tut?
In an attempt to solve the mystery, scientists are X-raying the mummy of the
A pharaoh refers to an ancient Egyptian king.
""The question of whether [King Tut] was murdered or not will be completely answered,"" said Egypt's top archaeologist.
King Tut lived in Egypt more than 3,300 years ago. Despite suffering from a spine disease that made it difficult for him to turn his head, Tut probably spent his childhood swimming in the Nile River, hunting ducks, and learning how to read and write.
After his father died, the young boy was thrown into the royal spotlight. Tut was crowned king at about the age of 10! His reign, however, did not last very long. By 18 years old, he was dead.
Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, discovered King Tut's tomb in 1922.
The mystery of how King Tut died has fascinated people since Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, found his secret
in 1922. A tomb is a burial place.
Ancient Egyptians buried King Tut in an area of hidden caves called the Valley of the Kings. It is located near the Nile River. Tut's mummy was discovered with an elaborate gold mask covering its head and shoulders.
The tomb was filled with royal treasures, including jewelry, statues, furniture, and even some of Tut's childhood toys. Ancient Egyptians believed in life after death. They buried their dead with favorite items they believed could be used in the afterlife.
murdered, crime experts believe the culprit was likely someone close to him. Scientists have narrowed the list to four suspects: his wife, his treasurer, his prime minister, and his military chief.
They suspect those four people because they would have known about Tut's spine disease. His weak condition would have made him an easy target. They also might have had
, or reasons, to murder Tut. (See ""
Why do scientists think Tut was killed? They say the tomb's small size and its rushed state hint that he might have died unexpectedly.
At the time of the tomb's discovery in 1922, experts had ruled out foul play. Yet X-rays taken in 1968 revealed a different story. They showed a hole in Tut's skull, suggesting he might have suffered a severe blow to the head.
Tut's mummy was flown to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for new X-rays. X-ray technology today is more sophisticated than it was in 1968. Thanks to modern
, or crime-solving techniques, scientists hope the question of whether Tut was murdered will soon be answered.
Was a crime committed? Clues point to four main suspects.
Although paintings in Tut's tomb depict a loving wife, experts say she could still have had a motive. Shortly after Tut died, his wife wrote a letter to the leader of another nation. She requested help in finding a new husband. In ancient Egypt, it was possible for women to become pharaohs. Did she murder her husband to become pharaoh herself?
Tut's treasurer, Maya, had easy access to him during his reign. Evidence, however, shows that Maya liked the boy king. He rebuilt Tut's burial chamber after it was robbed. A gift in Tut's tomb also bears Maya's name. Although Maya was the least likely to ascend to the throne after Tut's death, could the treasurer have been so jealous of the boy king that he murdered him?
Ay was Tut's adviser and grandfather. He became pharaoh upon Tut's death. After Tut died, Ay pressured Tut's wife to marry him. Marrying her made him king of Egypt. Shortly after their wedding, the new bride mysteriously disappeared. Some people think a painting of a hunting scene in Ay's tomb proves his crime. The painting was an odd choice for a royal tomb. Was Ay confessing his crime through the killing in the painting?
War threatened Egypt during Tut's rule. His military chief might have thought the boy king was too young to protect Egypt from its enemies. Because the chief drove Tut's chariot, some experts suspect that he pushed the young pharaoh to his death. After the prime minister's death, the military chief became king of Egypt. At that time, he attempted to erase records of Tut's life. Could that have been to cover up a crime?

Is your backpack weighing you down? If so, consider lightening your load. A recent study shows that lugging around a bulky backpack that doesn't fit correctly can lead to poor
If someone tells you that good posture is important, that person is referring to the position of your body when you stand, sit, or walk. Carrying around too much weight in your backpack can force you to bend forward. Slouching over can round your shoulders and cause your upper back to curve.
Over time, the extra stress on your back can create posture problems. Some doctors think those problems may lead to neck and back pain.
Thirteen children, ages 8 and 9, participated in the backpack study. They walked about 1,130 feet. That is about the average length of a child's walk to school. The kids walked with backpacks that weighed 9 to 13 pounds. The children also walked without backpacks.
The study's researchers found that the heavier the backpack load, the more children bent down to support its weight. Afterward, some kids complained that their lower backs and shoulders hurt.
Heidi Orloff, one of the researchers, said that she could tell when the backpacks were too heavy or the kids were tired. ""The kids' chins drop to their chests,"" she told
An estimated 40 million school-age children in the United States use backpacks. Some health groups say that more than half of those students may be carrying backpacks heavy enough to affect their posture.
When worn correctly, backpacks have many benefits. They have lots of compartments that help you stay organized. Compared with shoulder bags, backpacks are a better way to carry around the items you need for school. Your body's strongest muscles-in the back and stomach-support the weight of a backpack. A shoulder bag often puts strain unevenly on your body.
However, most health experts recommend that kids carry backpacks that are no more than 15 percent of their body weight. That means a 70-pound student should wear a backpack that weighs less than 10 1/2 pounds. Orloff also said that spot checks around the country show that many children are carrying backpacks that weigh between 20 and 25 pounds. Now, that's quite a burden!
Below, you'll find some tips to help ease your load. Your back will thank you!
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Use both shoulder straps and fasten the waist strap to balance the weight evenly.
Adjust the shoulder straps so that the backpack is close to your body.
Pack only what you need and place the heaviest items closest to the center of your back.
What are other ways you can help improve your posture?
That means you should bend at the knees when you pick up your backpack.

188	3	"In June, a small car pulled up outside the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad. Three men unloaded a wrapped object from the trunk, handed it to museum officials, and sped off in the mid afternoon heat. No questions asked.
Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.
""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate.""
Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old
, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.
Along with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April.
At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or
, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.
One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind.""
. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.
Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.
Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.
Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy.
The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing.""
Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,
means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.
Here are some of the Iraqi National Museum's valuable artifacts and their status at the time
This 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.
This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.
How did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?
Originally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world's earliest writing. It was found on the museum's second floor, away from the riots.

Light consists of transverse waves in which the electromagnetic vibrations are at 90º to the direction of travel. The speed of a wave can be calculated using its frequency and wavelength. Lasers produce intense narrow beams of light.
Waves are vibrations that transfer energy from place to place without matter - solid, liquid or gas - being transferred. Think of a Mexican wave in a football crowd. The wave moves around the stadium, while each spectator stays in their seat - only moving up, and then down, when it is their turn.

Huge amounts of water move in and out of river mouths each day because of the tides. A tidal barrage is

Solar cells are devices that convert light energy directly into electrical energy. You may have seen small solar cells in calculators. Larger arrays of solar cells are used to power road signs in remote areas, and even larger arrays are used to power satellites in orbit around Earth.
Solar panels do not generate electricity, but rather they heat up water. They are often located on the roofs of buildings where they can receive heat energy from the sun. The diagram outlines how they work.

2155	4	"> Listening - Showing you are listening
It sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it.
Good listeners show that they are listening by:
Making eye contact with the person that is talking to them
Using facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is said
Allowing the person who is speaking finish before they respond
Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand
Referring back to comments that have already been made
Read this conversation between Abdul, Emily and Matt. Can you find any examples of good listening skills?
In a classroom. General classroom noise in the background.
In a fight, right, who do you think would win -
(Interrupts) Shut up, Abdul! I'm trying to concentrate.
There's four of them. They'd take him down. Knock him cold.
So you're saying that Tinky Winky and Laa-Laa have a violent streak?
No, but if they had to, if they were forced - them against him - the Teletubbies would have it, any day of the week.
Because it would be four against one?
Yeah, the Teletubbies are a team. Bob's a Larry.
We'd better be quiet. We're annoying her.
Choose the statement that is most true:
Emily is the best listener, because she says the least and she's just trying to get on with her work
Matt shows that he is listening because he asks questions to make sure that he understands what Abdul really means, and he is sensitive towards Emily's feelings.
None of them are good listeners and anyway, they shouldn't be chatting in class.

1947	4	"Questioning is an important skill that shows your teacher that you are listening carefully. There are two main types of questions.
These are the type of questions where there is only a yes or no answer or only one possible answer: eg Are you male or female?
These questions let the person answering share their thoughts and ideas more fully: eg What do you think of the new English teacher?
You can show that you are listening carefully to the answer of a closed or open question, by asking another question:
""What exactly do you mean by that?""
Or by checking that you've understood correctly by repeating back to that person what you thought they meant:
""So, you're saying that you think that violence is never the right answer?""
For their Speaking and Listening assessment, Matt has been paired with Tim. Matt has to interview Tim about his favourite character in the play, Romeo and Juliet. Tim is really shy and hates speaking. To get good marks himself, Matt knows that he has to encourage Tim to speak too.
Can you spot the listening skills that Matt uses to help Tim?
Why do you like him better than say, one of the main characters, like Romeo?
He's not so much of a show off.
Do you mean he doesn't talk as much as Romeo?
Yes. (Long pause) It's not just that. He's down to earth.
Whereas Romeo is away with the fairies?
(Laughs) Not exactly. A bit, I s'pose. I just meant that I like Benvolio because he's the only one that just tries to get by without getting into trouble.
Matt has good listening skills - when Tim gives a one word answer, Matt prompts him by asking further questions and he engages with Tim.

Presentations are sometimes less formal than speeches, and you'll probably be asked to present in groups rather than on your own. Use the tips on the previous page to make your performance strong.
Here are some extra tips for group presentations:
Organise the presentation fairly between each group member - ensure that everyone gets their chance to present. If you're shy, don't hide behind your group - you need to take part too!
A group presention needs to come across as a team effort - be careful not to allow over enthusiastic members to dominate.
Work together - if one person is speaking, another person can point to relevant visual aids.
You may be asked to find a poem or an extract from a story to read aloud to your class. Here are some tips to help you with reading aloud:
If you can choose a text you are familiar with this will probably boost your confidence.
Practise your reading using gestures and movement, and don't be tempted to hide behind your book.
Try to look up from your reading several times and make eye contact with your audience.
Vary your pitch and tone and make it relevant to your subject matter. If you're reading something spooky, try to reflect this in your voice. If you're reading a conversation between two characters, attempt to distinguish their voices.
Think about volume and pace - ensure that your audience can hear you clearly.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!

How is information added to a wave?
Signals are encoded and sent from a transmitter to a receiver, where they are decoded.
Optical fibres can carry more information than an ordinary cable of the same diameter.
Signals can be either analogue or digital. Digital signals maintain their quality over longer distances than analogue signals.
Signals are sent from a transmitter to a receiver. This can be done in many ways: using

Identify statements that are data and statements that offer an explanation. For example, data is produced from an investigation and often but not always includes numbers.

If a scientist grows a micro-organism and counts the number of micro-organisms present every thirty minutes, the numbers he or she collects is

in an explanation. For example, sometimes the data collected from an investigation does not immediately lead to an explanation. When Alexander Fleming noticed that bacteria were not growing next to the penicillium mould it took imagination and creativity for him to think that maybe the mould was producing a chemical that was killing the bacteria. That is how antibiotics were discovered.
Identify a scientific question for which there is not an agreed answer. For example, did life evolve on planet Earth or did it arrive on a meteorite from outer space? Because no one was there at the time it is impossible to give an exact answer.
Suggest why scientists involved in the same research sometimes disagree with each other. For example, many years ago, when scientists were first trying to date how old a fossil was, they sometimes disagreed. It was only when more evidence became available that they began to agree on the fossil’s age.
You will also need to be able to suggest why some scientists are reluctant to change their minds and explanations, even when new evidence is found that contradicts them. This is often due to the fact that scientists devote their lives to their research. To realise that, after all the years they have spent on it, their theory was wrong, is very difficult to accept.

A tropical rain forest is warm and has heavy rainfall. The Amazon, in South America, is the largest rain forest in the world.
Yet the Amazon’s future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape.
has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate.
Why should we worry about a rain forest that is thousands of miles from where we live? Deforestation reduces the rain forest’s
or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the sun’s heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earth’s climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazil’s government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The government’s efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

move through a conductor. The moving electrons can collide with the atoms of the conductor. This makes it more difficult for the current to flow, and causes resistance.
Electrons collide with atoms more often in a long wire than they do in a short one. A thin wire has fewer electrons to carry the current than a thick wire. This means the resistance in a wire increases as:

A graph of current - vertical axis - against potential difference - horizontal axis - shows you how the current flowing through a component varies with the potential difference across it.
You should be able to recognise these graphs for resistors at constant temperature, for filament lamps, and for diodes.
The current flowing through a resistor at a constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. A component that gives a graph like the one to the right is said to follow Ohm’s Law.
The filament lamp is a common type of light bulb. It contains a thin coil of wire called the filament. This heats up when an electric current passes through it, and produces light as a result.
The filament lamp does not follow Ohm’s Law. Its resistance increases as the temperature of its filament increases. So the current flowing through a filament lamp is not directly proportional to the voltage across it. This is the graph of current against voltage for a filament lamp.
You should be able to recognise the graph of current against voltage for a diode.
Diodes are electronic components that can be used to regulate the potential difference in circuits and to make logic gates. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) give off light and are often used for indicator lights in electrical equipment such as computers and television sets.
The diode has a very high resistance in one direction. This means that current can only flow in the other direction. This is the graph of current against potential difference for a diode.
You should be able to recognise the circuit symbols for the thermistor and the LDR (light-dependent resistor), and know how the resistance of these components can be changed.
Thermistors are used as temperature sensors - for example, in fire alarms. Their resistance decreases as the temperature increases:
At low temperatures, the resistance of a thermistor is high and little current can flow through them.
At high temperatures, the resistance of a thermistor is low and more current can flow through them.
LDRs (light-dependent resistors) are used to detect light levels, for example, in automatic security lights. Their resistance decreases as the light intensity increases:
In the dark and at low light levels, the resistance of an LDR is high and little current can flow through it.
In bright light, the resistance of an LDR is low and more current can flow through it.

208	3	"New York City Subway: Then and Now
New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is a billionaire who could take a limousine to work. Instead, he rides the subway to his office at City Hall each morning.
""A hundred years ago, a generation of New Yorkers had the courage and conviction to build a subway system that transformed our city,"" said Mayor Bloomberg. ""Today our subway is the backbone of New York.""
On October 27, 2004, New York City marked the
, or hundredth anniversary, of its subway system with special ceremonies. As part of the celebration, people took tours to retrace the original 9.1-mile route from City Hall to Harlem.
Construction began on the subway in 1900 and took 12,000 workers four years to complete. At that time, the population of New York City was 3.4 million and growing. People, horse-drawn carriages, trolleys, and vendors packed city streets.
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Detroit Publishing Company Collection, [reproduction numbers, LC-D4-17293 (L), LC-D4-17294 (R)]
Left: City Hall subway station c1900-1906; right: Construction of the Brooklyn Bridge subway station, around 1904.
City officials believed that a subway system would help people get around faster and allow them to move into outer areas. What started out as one subway line with 28 stations has grown into 26 lines with 468 stations. A fare in 1904 cost only a nickel. Today, about 4.5 million people ride the subway daily and pay $2 a ride.
The subway has seen plenty of change since 1904. Over the years, workers have restored many old subway stations. They have found mosaics and murals hidden under dirt.
Public artwork now graces 140 subway stations as part of the Art for Transit program. ""You can probably say that the New York subway system is one of the largest art museums in the world,"" Roxanne Robertson of the New York Transit Museum told

SECTION 2 - Act 3, Scene 1 (whole scene)
There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off. Some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,
And makes my labours pleasures. O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed –
And he's composed of harshness! I must remove
Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget –
– But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
, who watches from a distance, unseen.
Work not so hard! I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!
Pray, set it down, and rest you. When this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study. Pray, now, rest yourself.
The sun will set before I shall discharge
I'll bear your logs the while. Pray give me that:
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
As well as it does you – and I should do it
With much more ease, for my good will is to it,
No, noble mistress. 'Tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you –
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers –
I have broke your hest to say so!
Indeed the top of admiration – worth
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard, and many a time
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues
Have I liked several women – never any
With so full soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,
And put it to the foil. But you – o you,
So perfect and so peerless – are created
One of my sex – no woman's face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father. How features are abroad,
I am skilless of – but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you –
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
Something too wildly, and my father's precepts
A prince, Miranda: I do think, a King
I would not so! – and would no more endure
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service – there resides,
To make me slave to it – and for your sake
O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
And crown what I profess with kind event,
If I speak true! If hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief! I,
Beyond all limit of what else i'the world,
To weep at what I am glad of.
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
What I desire to give; and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling –
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife if you will marry me:
If not, I'll die your maid. To be your fellow
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
(He kneels) And I thus humble ever.
As bondage e'er of freedom! Here's my hand.
And mine, with my heart in't. And now farewell
So glad of this as they I cannot be,
Who are surprised with all – but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book –
For yet, ere supper-time, must I perform

Hua Mei is a giant panda who celebrated her second birthday last week. Born on August 21, 1999, at the San Diego Zoo in California, Hua Mei is the only giant panda born in the United States to live more than four days.
When she was born, Hua Mei looked like a pink rat the size of a cell phone. She weighed only 4 ounces.
For two weeks after Hua Mei was born, her mother, Bai Yun, held on to her without ever letting go. Bai Yun was careful because she didn't want to crush Hua Mei. At the time, Bai Yun weighed 200 pounds!
Since Hua Mei's birth, millions of people have seen her. Thousands of people flock to her den each day.
""She's so cute,"" Rebecca Ralston, age 11, said after seeing the panda. ""She's like a big teddy bear.""
The giant panda is one of the rarest animals. As few as 1,000 pandas survive in the wild.
Giant pandas live only in the bamboo forests of China, which are being destroyed. Loggers have cut down vast areas of those forests. The trees are used for firewood and to make buildings. Farmers use the cleared forests to grow crops.
To protect the giant panda, China has set up 33

Panda scientists at the San Diego Zoo say they want to help increase the number of pandas living in the wild. ""Someday, we may be able to raise pandas in captivity and release them to the wild,"" panda scientist Don Lyndberg told Weekly Reader. For now, pandas remain on the edge of extinction.

1426	2	"Nine-year-old Selso, his sister, and his brothers never had a toilet or electricity in their house. The house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. The tsunami (soo-NAH-mee) that hit one year ago destroyed their home.
Selso (front center) and his family now have a brand-new house that was painted sky blue.
Much has changed in a year for Selso and his family. Volunteers with Habitat for Humanity recently built them a new house. More important, the workers brought hope. ""My parents are so happy. My mother had tears in her eyes,"" Selso told
Habitat for Humanity is a group that builds new homes for people who are poor. Habitat volunteers from seven countries, including the United States, traveled long hours to help families who lost their homes in the tsunami. Selso’s family worked side by side with the volunteers.
Debris of beach resorts washed away in the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami at Khao Lak, Thailand, seen December 30.
Selso lives in a small fishing village by the sea near Kanyakumari, India. India was one of 12 countries hit by the tsunami on December 26, 2004. Tens of thousands of people lost their lives. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky. We only lost our home,"" says Selso.
A year later, many people in India are still homeless. Volunteers plan on building another 10,000 homes there over the next two years.
""[The volunteers] didn’t even know us, but they came here to help,"" says Selso’s dad. ""This is the happiest day for my family. My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework.""
Selso’s family is thankful to have a home and clean water. What are some things for which you are thankful?
Along with rebuilding homes in India, volunteers are installing (setting up for use) plumbing. That way, families can have clean water. Clean water is important for good health. Our bodies can survive without food for two months or longer, but we can survive without water for only a few days.

Magnesium burns very brightly when heated in air
Some metals are very unreactive. That means they do not easily take part in chemical reactions. For example platinum does not react with oxygen in the air, even if it is heated in a Bunsen burner flame.
Some metals are very reactive. They easily take part in chemical reactions to make new substances.
Magnesium is like this. If it is heated in a Bunsen burner, it ignites and burns with a brilliant white flame.
The reactivity series for some common metals
Other metals may be more reactive than magnesium, or in between magnesium and platinum. If we put the metals in order of their reactivity, from most reactive down to least reactive, we get a list called the

Approximation - Rounding to a given number of places
Decimal places are counted from the decimal point:
So, the number 5.1492 has four decimal places and 4.34 has two decimal places.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places, look at the number in the next decimal place.
If it's less than 5 round down
If it's 5 or more, round up
Q1. Round 7.2648 to 2 decimal places (d.p.)
Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place
To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).
You need to write both decimal places, even though the second number is a zero, to show you rounded to two decimal places.
Remember to look at the number after the one you're interested in. If it's less than 5, round down. If it's 5 or more, round up.
Round up, round up and try this activity!

Sometime between 1939 and 1941, Byrd or one of his group buried a Hershey chocolate bar in the ice near the South Pole. The candy bar remained buried for 60 years.
Then, in January 2001, explorer Douglas Stoup found the candy bar buried in 2.5 feet of ice. Stoup donated it to the Hershey Museum in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
After 60 years, the candy bar, which weighs about 4 ounces, probably doesn't taste very good. In fact, it was never meant to. The U.S. Army had asked Hershey to make special candy bars, called Field Ration Bars, as a test. The bars were made to give soldiers lots of energy and not melt easily. The Army told Hershey the bars should taste ""just a little better than a boiled potato,"" so that soldiers wouldn't eat too many of them.

A circle on a graph will join up all the points at a distance from a given point. The diagram shows a circle radius 5 with the centre at the origin. Any point on the circle must be a distance of 5 from the origin.
An equation for the circle can be found using Pythagoras' Theorem.
The equation for a circle, centre the origin and radius r is x
For the circle below, r = 5, x = 4 and y = 3
So the equation of the circle is x
Point (4,3) is on the circle because 4
You can also find the equation of circles when the centre is not at the origin.
Find the equation of the circle with the centre at (3, 2) and radius 5.
Mark a point P (x, y) on the circle, and draw in a right-angled triangle. The lengths of the sides of the triangle are r (y - 2) and (x - 3).
to find the equation of the circle: (x - 3)
Circle centre (3,2) with radius 5. If P (x, y) is a point on the circle, CPQ is a right angled triangle with sides as shown.
Here are the sketch graphs of the trigonometric functions f(x) = sinx°, f(x) = cosx° and f(x) = tanx°.
You may be asked to draw or sketch these graphs in your exam. Try to remember what they look like, and follow these tips:
If you are asked to draw or plot the graph, you will need to use your calculator to generate the y values.
If you are asked to plot the graph of f(x) = sinx° for 0°
360°, use your calculator to find sin0°, sin10°, sin20°, ...., sin360°, and then plot these values on the graph paper.
Plotting a trigonometric graph is time-consuming, so it is more likely that you will be asked to sketch the graph. However, even if you think you remember what the graph looks like, you can use your calculator to check. For example, sin0° = 0 and cos0° = 1, so you have the starting points of the graphs. Tan90° has no value (your calculator will display an error message), so you know that the graph cannot cross the line x = 90°.

To win the prize, McNally competed against 47 other contestants in the 2003 National Monopoly Championship.
The tournament was held aboard a train hired especially for the event. Called the ""Reading Railroad,"" the train was named after a railroad property on the game board.
Although the tournament has taken place every four years since 1973, this year's event was the first to be held on a moving train. Players boarded in Chicago and began rolling the dice.
In 1934, Charles B. Darrow of Pennsylvania invented Monopoly. The Parker Brothers company bought the game in 1935 and has since sold more than 200 million copies worldwide.
From there, the train completed a three-day journey to Atlantic City, New Jersey-the city on which the game is based and where the final round was held. Along the way, the train made stops in Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia.
In addition to his prize money, McNally looks forward to representing the United States in the 2004 World Monopoly Championship in China. ""I can't wait,"" McNally told CNN.

2630	5	"Evaluating music is really about comparing one piece of music with another, identifying the elements that make pieces of music different from one another.
Interpretation is the way performances change from player to player. For example, one player might play the music faster, or might play using different dynamics or phrasing.
No two performers play music in the same way, because each performer interprets the music differently. Here's a checklist of factors to bear in mind when you discuss interpretation in the exam:
: how loud or quiet the music is
: all referring to the speed at which music is played
: how strictly the performers play in time
When listening to two versions of the same song or piece of music you need to think about both the similarities and differences.
Use comparative language, words like louder, quieter, faster, slower.
the type of instruments or voices used (eg soprano or bass voice, strings, brass or percussion)
the number of instruments or parts (eg solo, duet, trio, string ensemble or orchestra)
the structure of the music (eg introduction, movement, coda, sonata, concerto, song)
the type of accompaniment (eg vamping, oom-pa, Alberti bass, arpeggio)
which of the versions you prefer and why
Now have a go yourself. Listen to these two pieces which employ the same melody: first
by Sweetbox. See if you can identify 3 features the pieces have in common (apart from the tune!) and 3 contrasting features.
The kind of features you should have noticed:
tempo in second piece is quicker than the first- the first is largo, the second more upbeat
Tonality change - first minor, second major
Violins plays melody / legato / smoothly
Instrumentation different - second added voices and drum kit

Below is a list of other common musical terms that you should be able to use when describing and comparing pieces of music:
A small group of instruments made of violins, violas, cellos and double basses
Large group of instruments made up of members of the four families - strings, woodwind, brass and percussion
A scale consisting of all the 12 semitones of the octave
A scale made up of five notes used a lot in traditional Chinese and Scottish Music- usually has no semitones
Music that is based on one of the scales of seven pitch classes commonly found in western music but excluding the major and minor scales- used in early and world music
A type of scale used in Indian music
The end section which rounds off a piece or a movement
Made up of three sections like a sandwich (A-B-A)
A 3-part from, with an exposition, followed by a development, and finally a recapitulation
Playing block chords continuously throughout a section or piece
Chords played in three time to accompany a waltz
Accompaniment consisting of chords broken up into patterns played in the left hand of the piano
Sounding of chord where notes are spread one after the other, usually in intervals of three
Here is a short musical example of different musicians performing Rimsky Korsakov's
. Listen carefully to each one, and try to decide how the piece has been differently interpreted.
performed by Michael Rabin, violin (Real Audio clip)
performed by David Helfgott, piano (Real Audio clip)
Here are three examples of pupils work describing the performances:
Both versions are played allegro with crescendo, diminuendo phrases as the melodic motive rises and falls. In the first version a string ensemble enters and then the violin solo part takes over the melody. The solo violin is playing fast semi-quaver passages in separate bows. In the second version a solo pianist performs all parts, interweaving the separate parts between left and right hand. In the first version a flute enters to play an answering melodic phrase. Thus, although both version are allegro, and demonstrate the same dynamic ranges. However the orchestration changes as the first is arranged for a solo violin with string and flute backing. The second is arranged solely for piano.
Both versions are examples of the same tune but are played by different instruments. Both are fast. In the first example there is a solo violin and in the second a solo piano part. The first version is accompanied whereas the second is not.
Both versions play the same song but are played on different instruments. The speed is the same in both.

Telescopes are devices used to observe the universe. There are many different types and some are even sited in space.
Optical telescopes observe visible light from space. Small ones allow amateurs to view the night sky relatively cheaply but there are very large optical telescopes sited around the world for professional astronomers to use.
Optical telescopes on the ground have some disadvantages:
they can only be used at night
they cannot be used if the weather is poor or cloudy
Radio telescopes detect radio waves coming from space. Although they are usually very large and expensive, these telescopes have an advantage over optical telescopes. They can be used in bad weather because the radio waves are not blocked by clouds as they pass through the atmosphere. Radio telescopes can also be used in the daytime as well as at night.
X-rays are partly blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and so X-ray telescopes need to be at high altitude or flown in balloons.

Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a president’s term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nation’s laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? It’s up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters’ minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans’ support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say it’s time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans don’t have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.
Which election issues are most important to you and your family? Why?

Níl sé iontach óg agus síleann daoine go bhfuil sé measartha aosta anois. Is féidir go n-éireoidh sé as an pheil mar go bhfuil sé aosta.
Is as Tír Eoghain mé agus is breá liom Peadar Ó Ceannabháin. Beidh sé ag imirt ar fhoireann Thír Eoghain arís i mbliana agus bainfidh sé Sam Maguire arís fosta. Tír Eoghain Abú!
Is peileadóir iontach maith é agus tá suim mhór aige sa pheil Ghaelach. Tá sé sciliúil agus díograiseach. Bíonn sé ag traenáil go minic - gach lá agus gach oíche. Is duine cainteach cairdiúil é fosta.. Imríonn sé peil le foireann Earagail Chiaráin agus le Tír Eoghain.
Tá suim mhór agam sa spórt agus is breá liom sacar agus galf. Is fearr liom peil Ghaelach, áfach, agus beidh mé ag caint ar imreoir peile sa chur i láthair seo. Imríonn Peadar Ó Ceannabháin ar fhoireann Thír Eoghain. Is fear beag é ach tá sé iontach láidir. Tá sé ina chónaí i gContae Thír Eoghain agus tá sé pósta.
Bhain Tír Eoghain Sam Maguire den chéad uair anuraidh. Bhí Peadar Ó Ceannabháin ag imirt ach bhí sé gortaithe fosta. D'imir sé in éadan Ard Mhacha sa chluiche ceannais i bPáirc an Chrócaigh. Bhí sé mar chaptaen ar an fhoireann.
You could summarise the presentation under the following five headings:
- sport and especially Gaelic football; favourite player (Peter Canavan); description (age, appearance, home, marital status, children, etc.).
- All-Ireland Final last year against Armagh; Tyrone won and Peter was captain; how he played and what he scored; Sam Maguire and celebrations.
- very fit and he loves Gaelic football; Errigal Ciaran and Tyrone; very good footballer - skillful and dedicated; training every day.
- P.E. teacher in a secondary school in Co. Tyrone; may not be teaching this year because of work with football; he may not play for Tyrone next year because he may be too old.
- excellent footballer; I was so happy when he lifted Sam Maguire; Come on Tyrone!
In the exam the prompt card can usually have five bullet points of what you want to say. These bullet points can be in Irish. You can prepare the card well in advance of the exam so make sure you check vocabulary, gender and pronunciation thoroughly. If in doubt ask your teacher.
This is how Séamus's prompt card might look in Irish:
- spórt agus peil Ghaelach, Peadar Ó Ceannabháin (33, beag, tanaí, láidir, pósta, triúr clainne).
- Cluiche ceannais anuraidh in éadan Ard Mhacha; Bhain Tír Eoghain; captaen; d'imir sé go maith; cúpla pointe; Sam Maguire, cóisir mhór.
- aclaí; suim mhór sa pheil; Earagail Chiaráin agus Tír Eoghain; peileadóir iontach maith, sciliúil; díograiseach; ag traenáil gach lá.
- múinteoir corpoideachais, meánscoil i gCo. Thír Eoghain; Ní bheidh sé ag teagasc i mbliana; obair leis an pheil; an bhliain seo chugainn; ró-aosta.
- peileadóir den scoth; an-sásta, Sam Maguire; Tír Eoghain abú!
This is a very good presentation. Séamus has included lots of information about his chosen famous person and has used the past, present and future tenses effectively. He has introduced his topic well with detailed background information and has used structures and vocabulary already known to him from his description of himself. He has also chosen a topic which he is genuinely interested in, therefore making it easier for himself to adopt an enthusiastic approach to the subject. He has concluded by offering a range of opinions, all of which he has explained and for which he has given reasons. His presentation has a clear start, middle and end and offers the listener a well-structured presentation on his chosen topic.
Sa chur i láthair seo beidh mé ag caint ar Pheadar Ó Ceannabháin. Tá Peadar Ó Ceannabháin trí bliana is tríocha d'aois. Tá sé measartha beag agus tanaí ach tá sé iontach láidir. Tá a chuid gruaige gairid agus tá a shúile gorm. Tá sé ina chónaí i mBaile Uí Dhálaigh i gContae Thír Eoghain i dtuaisceart na hÉireann. Tá sé pósta agus tá triúr clainne aige.
Is duine iontach aclaí é agus tá suim mhór aige sa pheil Ghaelach. Imríonn sé peil Ghaelach d'fhoireann Earagail Chiaráin agus d'fhoireann Thír Eoghain. Is peileadóir iontach maith é. Tá sé iontach sciliúil agus díograiseach. Bíonn sé ag traenáil gach lá agus tá sé ag éirí níos fearr.
D'imir sé sa Chluiche Ceannais anuraidh in éadan Ard Mhacha agus bhain Tír Eoghain. Bhí áthas an domhain ar Pheadar Ó Ceannabháin an lá sin. D'imir sé go measartha maith an lá sin agus fuair sé cúpla cúilín. I ndiaidh an chluiche thóg sé Sam Maguire agus bhí sé iontach sásta. Thug sé Sam Maguire ar ais go Tír Eoghain agus bhí cóisir mhór aige.
Is múinteoir corpoideachais é fosta. Bíonn sé ag teagasc i meánscoil i gContae Thír Eoghain. Ní bheidh sé ag teagasc i mbliana, áfach, mar tá a lán oibre aige leis an pheil. Is féidir nach mbeidh sé ag imirt peile ar an bhliain seo chugainn. Síleann sé go n-éireoidh sé as an pheil mar beidh sé ró-aosta.
Sílim gur peileadóir den scoth é agus bhí mé an-sásta nuair a thóg sé Sam Maguire. Tír Eoghain Abú!
In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!
After your presentation you will have to answer questions on it. Think about the kinds of questions you could be asked on this topic and prepare answers to them.
You are usually allowed to take a card in with you with five reminders of what you want to say. These should not be in complete sentences but might contain, for example, headings for each part of your talk or unusual words which you need.
Remember to learn the vocabulary you need to describe other people (especially famous people, sports stars and musicians), including how to talk about special features and aspects of their lives and careers. Make sure you can explain why you chose this topic and why you are interested in it.

Those celebrities are part of the rapidly growing Hispanic American population in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanic Americans now make up the largest minority group in the country. A
Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Those parts of the world include Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and most countries in Central America and South America. In the United States, many Hispanic Americans are also called Latinos.
As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.
Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our country’s history.
Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, told
that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.
People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASA’s training program. Ochoa, whose father’s parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.
Why is celebrating a variety of cultures important?

K2 is the second highest mountain in the world at 8611m. Mountain climbers say it is even harder to climb than Mount Everest, which was climbed one year before the first successful attempt on K2.
. Hypothermia and frostbite occur as the nose, fingers and toes begin to freeze. Winds can reach over 90 miles per hour and the dry air and physical exertion means that climbers can soon become dehydrated and need to drink up to six litres of water each day.
Also the amount of oxygen available to breathe drops with increasing altitude. At sea level the amount of oxygen in the air is about 21% with a pressure of 760 mmHg. As altitude increases the percentage remains the same but the pressure drops. At 3000m the pressure is 540 mmHg, at 5000m it is 420 mmHg and at the top of K2 can be as low as 253 mmHg. This means there are fewer oxygen molecules per breath so the breathing rate increases to try to get more oxygen into the blood.
Another problem experienced by many climbers is
. Low air pressure can cause fluid to leak from the capillaries in both the lungs and the brain. This results in a build-up of fluid. As the pressure drops and the fluid build up increases, the life-threatening condition of altitude sickness occurs.
Name the process by which the body keeps a constant internal environment.
What happens to the air pressure as climbers go up Mount Everest?
What percentage of the air is oxygen at the top of K2?
Describe two effects that high altitude can have on the human body.
A climber stays close to the top of K2 for two days. How much fluid are they likely to drink?
Explain what happens to the body temperature when hypothermia occurs at high altitude.
Explain why breathing rate increases as climbers get to higher altitudes.
To the nearest whole number, calculate the percentage of oxygen molecules available in each breath to a climber on top of K2 when compared to a person at sea level.
Describe the effect of cold temperatures on the skin and body of climbers.
Suggest what should be done for a climber that experiences altitude sickness.
Thoroughly check your answers as marks will be awarded for correct spelling, punctuation and grammar.

Writing question: Account of a road accident
Read this typical exam question and think about how you would answer it. You can write your answer on paper.
Chonaic tú taisme bóthair ar na mallaibh. Déan cur síos air. Luaigh na rudaí seo a leanas: (approx. 120 - 150 focal )
Cén uair a tharla an taisme agus cá háit?
Cad é mar a chríochnaigh an scéal?
Now read through the model answer written by Brian. It contains no mistakes.
Cúpla lá ó shin, nuair a bhí mé féin agus mo chara ag siúl abhaile ón scoil, chonaic mé cailín beag ag teacht amach as an siopa ag bun na sráide.
Rith sí trasna an bhóthair. Go tobann, tháinig carr thart an coirnéal. Ní fhaca an tiománaí an cailín agus bhuail sé í. Bhí an cailín ina luí ar an talamh gan aithne. Bhí imní an domhain orm.
Bhí an t-ádh orm mar bhí guthán póca agam agus chuir mé fios ar an otharcharr. I ndiaidh tamaill, tháinig na gardaí agus an t-otharcharr. Scrúdaigh an dochtúir an cailín agus dúirt sé go raibh a cos gortaithe ach ní raibh sí go dona tinn.
Tugadh an cailín go dtí an t-ospidéal. D'fhan sí thar oíche san ospidéal ach chuala mé ina dhiaidh sin go bhfuil sí ceart go leor anois - buíochas le Dia. Dúirt na gardaí go raibh an tiománaí ag dul róghasta. Ní dhéanfaidh mé dearmad ar an lá sin choíche.
A good piece of narrative writing at this level will contain:
a range of interesting and imaginative vocabulary
some complex sentences and a range of structures
ideas and opinions that are developed and justified
Think about why Brian's answer is good. Compare your answer with his and then move on to the next page to see the teacher's view.
A range of past tense verbs - in the positive and negative form.
Chonaic / Rith / Ní fhaca / Scrúdaigh

Read the question carefully. Identify the tenses you will need.
Writing a brief diagram or plan first will help focus your ideas.
Think about material you have prepared for your Presentation / Conversation - is any of it useful here?
Writing each task as a separate paragraph is a good way to organise your answer.
Try to keep the information in sequence - it helps to make sure everything has been covered and makes it easier to mark!
Use a suitable writing style - a
letter will need a date/address/an opening and a closing statement.
will not need any of these. Do not write a letter if asked for an account and vice versa.
Is it clear and easy to understand with no repetition of language?
Have you checked spelling and used a wide range of grammar structures?
Are the tenses used the correct ones? You will usually need to include the
Have you included a wide range of vocabulary, idioms and phrases and used them in a natural way? They add a lot to your writing.
Have you included link words where possible? eg.
Have you given an opinion / preference or point of view? eg.
Sílim /Ní shílim go bhfuil... Shíl mé / Níor shíl mé go raibh... Bhí / Ní raibh mé sásta mar... Tá / Níl mé sásta mar...
Have you developed the tasks where appropriate by adding some extra information? This will make your answer more varied and interesting.
Have you stuck to the word limit - not gone under and not gone over by too many words?
Have you covered each task? It is a good idea to tick each one off when completed.
Be sure to treat each task equally as they all carry equal marks.

919	1	"Imagine having to quit school to help your family earn money. Or think about what it might be like to be in a class with 49 other students and only one teacher.
Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them.
UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia.
Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country?
In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.
With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables.
One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.
Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.
To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.
Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.
Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school.
But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children.
UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.

show the structure of a population by comparing relative numbers of people in different age groups. Population structures differ markedly between
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
show population change over time - and also show marked differences between LEDCs and MEDCs.
At present the world's population is growing quickly, though this has not always been the case.
Until the 1800s the world's population grew slowly for thousands of years.
In 1820 the world's population reached one billion.
In the early 1970s, the world's population reached three billion.
In 1999, less than 30 years later, the population doubled to six billion.
The global rate of population growth is now one billion every 15 years.
The graph shows this pattern of accelerating growth:
The three main causes of population change are:
- usually measured using the birth rate (number of live births per 1000 of the population).
- usually measured using the death rate (number of deaths per 1000 of the population) .
- the movement of people in and out of an area.
of population change. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate of a country or place is called the
. The natural increase is calculated by subtracting the death rate from the birth rate.
natural increase = birth rate - death rate
The rate of natural increase is given as a percentage, calculated by dividing the natural increase by 10.
For example if the birth rate is 14 per 1000 population, and the death rate is 8 per 1000 population, then the growth rate = 14 - 8 = 6
Rates of population growth vary across the world. Although the world's total population is rising rapidly, not all countries are experiencing this growth. In the UK, for example, population growth is slowing, while in Germany the population has started to decline.
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].

More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
have high population growth rates. Both birth rates and death rates in LEDCs tend to be high. However, improving healthcare leads to death rates falling - while birth rates remain high.

The demographic transition measures population change over time, by studying birth rate and death rate. In stage one the high birth rate balances (matches) the high death rate. In stage two, the total population starts to rise as death rates start to fall, but birth rates remain quite high. In stage three, the population is still growing, but the gap between the birth rate and death rate narrows. In stage four, the total population is high, but it is balanced due to a low birth rate and a low death rate.

due to high birth rates and high death rates.
Total population rises as death rates fall due to improvements in health care and sanitation. Birth rates remain high.
Total population is still rising rapidly. The gap between birth and death rates narrows due to the availability of contraception and fewer children being needed to work - due to the mechanisation of farming. The
Natural increase is the natural growth of a population due to the number of births exceeding deaths. The rate of this increase can be calculated by subtracting the birth rate from the death rate.
Total population is high, but it is balanced by a low birth rate and a low death rate. Birth control is widely available and there is a desire for smaller families.
Total population is high but going into decline due to an ageing population. There is a continued desire for smaller families, with people opting to have children later in life.
As a country passes through the demographic transition model, the total population rises. Most
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income).

As populations move through the stages of the model, the gap between birth rate and death rate first widens, then narrows. In stage 1 the two rates are balanced. In stage 2 they

again, as the birth rate falls relative to the death rate. Finally in stage 4 the death and birth rates are balanced again but at a much lower level.
The demographic transition model has two limitations:
The model was developed after studying the experiences of countries in Western Europe and North America. Conditions might be different for

More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].

Population structure means the 'make up' or
composition is what something is made up of
of a population. Looking at the population structure of a place shows how the population is divided up between males and females of different age groups.
Population structure is usually shown using a
. A population pyramid can be drawn up for any area, from a whole continent or country to an individual town, city or village.
The following graphs show the population pyramids of an MEDC (the UK) and an LEDC (Mozambique), for 2000 and in 2025 using projected figures. The left side of each pyramid shows the number of men in each age group, the right side shows the number of women in each age group.
Notice how in the UK 2000 pyramid there is a bulge in the area of the 30-34 and 35-39 age groups, with the numbers thereafter reducing fairly steadily as the ages increase. This matches stage 4 of the demographic transition model.

Compare this to the 2025 pyramid, which would be stage 5 in the model. Here the bulge extends much further, covering the age groups 30-64, with the numbers beginning to reduce significantly only after 64.
Now compare the UK population pyramids with those for
In this graph, notice that in 2000 the 0-4 age group contained the largest number of people, with the numbers thereafter declining steadily as the ages increase. The graph matches stage 1 in the model.
In the second graph, the largest group in Mozambique in 2025 is still the 0-4 age group, but there are nearly as many people in the 5-29 age groups. Now the population pyramid matches stage 2.
Key things to know about population pyramids:
The shape of a population pyramid can tell us a lot about an area's population.
It gives us information about birth and death rates as well as
A population pyramid tells us how many

economically active people are those who are of working age.
Many LEDCs have a high number of
, whilst many MEDCs have a growing number of
A population pyramid that is very triangular (eg Mozambique in 2000) shows a population with a high number of young dependants and a low life expectancy.
A population pyramid that has fairly straight sides (more like a barrel) shows a population with a falling birth rate and a rising life expectancy.
Over time, as a country develops, the shape changes from triangular to barrel-like.
Places with an ageing population and a very low birth rate would have a structure that looks like an upside-down pyramid.

This is used just after a baby has been born. It is designed to detect genetic disorders that can be treated early. In the UK, all babies are screened for phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism and cystic fibrosis. Babies born to families that are at risk of sickle cell disease are tested for this disorder.

This is used to detect genetic disorders where the symptoms develop later in life, such as Huntington’s disorder. Predictive testing can be valuable to people who have no symptoms but have a family member with a genetic disorder. The results can help to inform decisions about possible medical care.
Genetic tests are not available for every possible inherited disorder. And they are not completely reliable. They may produce false positive, or false negative, results. These can have serious consequences.
A false positive occurs when a genetic test has wrongly detected a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family could believe something is wrong when it is not. This may lead them to decide not to start a family, or to choose an abortion, in order to avoid having a baby with a genetic disorder.
A false negative happens when a genetic test has failed to detect a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family would be wrongly reassured. This may lead them to decide to start a family or continue with a pregnancy.

The cartoons in the comics section may make you laugh, but another type of cartoon will also make you think. It's called an
. An editorial cartoon expresses an opinion about specific people or events in the news.
Lately, many editorial cartoonists have been focusing on the presidential candidates and the election. Artist Gary Markstein created two political illustrations to express his opinions about this year's election.
The economy is one of the main issues in this year's presidential election. (The economy refers to the way a country runs its jobs and industries.) The economy is like the weather--sometimes it's good, and other times it's bad. Political polls show that many people ""vote with their pocketbook."" That is, they vote based on how the economy is doing.
to make his point about the economy. Symbols are objects that represent other things. One cartoon shows two weather maps labeled ""Economy."" George W. Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols.
A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?
Do you think the cartoonist prefers one candidate over the other? Why or why not?
What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and
between candidates. In politics, mudslinging refers to speaking negatively about another person or opposing party.
To make his point, the artist shows two men talking about dirt for sale. One man says to the other, ""The Bush and Kerry campaigns each ordered 2 tons...""
Why might the Bush and Kerry campaigns be ordering mud?
What message do you think the cartoonist is sending about the election campaign?
When Gary Markstein was in the fourth grade, he dreamed of being a cartoonist and having his own comic strip. He even put out a humor magazine with a friend that lasted for one issue.
Today, Markstein's audience is much larger. He draws cartoons for the
Markstein draws five cartoons a week that focus on politics and sports. To get ideas, he reads several newspapers each morning. ""Coming up with a good idea is the hardest and most challenging part, but it's also the most rewarding,"" he told
What's the best part of his job? ""I get paid to play!"" said Markstein. ""I draw on a different topic every day. I think it's the best job in the world!""
If you think you'd like to be an editorial cartoonist, Markstein has some tips:
Draw well and write well. (Yes, there is writing in most cartoons!)
Read the newspaper to learn what is going on in the world.
Be creative, use your imagination, and have a good sense of humor!

Operation Migration workers train the young whoopers to follow very light aircraft called

The whooping crane is an endangered bird. Only one flock of whooping cranes lives naturally in the wild. Those birds migrate between Canada and Texas. Scientists decided that having more than one flock would keep these birds from dying out.
Whooping cranes trained by Operation Migration in the past have remembered the route. They return to Wisconsin each spring and fly back to Florida in the fall.
""We want our birds to pay attention to us for the first year, until we get them down to Florida,"" said Duff. ""After that, we hope they communicate with wild birds and become wild birds themselves.""
In October, pilots will lead the new flock of whoopers south for the winter. The migration route will take them over seven states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and finally Florida.

Food chains - Toxic materials in the food chain
Toxic materials are poisonous. Some quickly break down into harmless substances in the environment. Others are
and do not break down. Instead, they accumulate in the food chain and damage the organisms in it, especially the top predators.
Mercury compounds were used until quite recently to make
(chemicals that kill the insects that damage crops) and special
that stop barnacles growing on the hulls of ships.
Unfortunately, when it gets into the food chain mercury damages the
of mammals, including humans. The diagram shows how mercury can accumulate in the food chain.
Tiny plankton in the sea absorb the mercury compounds. When the plankton are eaten by small fish, the mercury they contain stays in the fish. As the fish need to eat a lot of plankton, the concentration of mercury in them becomes higher than its concentration in the plankton.
The small fish are eaten by larger fish, and these are eaten by still larger ones, such as tuna fish. This creates a high concentration of mercury in the tuna. People eating contaminated tuna may get mercury poisoning. Mercury is now banned from many chemical products and mercury use in industry is carefully regulated.
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks. It can accumulate in the birds of prey, giving them a large amount of DDT. Concentrations of DDT in birds causes weakness in their eggs, and reduces their population. DDT is now banned because of this.

Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

At their meeting, the astronomers agreed on a new definition for a planet. A planet must be nearly round and must circle the sun. Its orbit should not cross the orbit of another planet. Pluto’s orbit crosses Neptune’s. Now there are only eight ""classical"" planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Pluto still has a place in space, though. It is one of a new group of smaller objects called
The two other members are Ceres (SIHR-eez), the largest asteroid, and a space object nicknamed ""Xena."" As many as 12 dwarf planets are expected to be announced in the coming months. The list will keep growing as new objects are discovered.
""These dwarf planets are popping up everywhere,"" astronomer Alan Stern told
Pluto was discovered in 1930, long after the other planets had been found. It was discovered by the American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (1906-1997) using a telescope in Flagstaff, Arizona. He didn’t name Pluto, though. An 11-year-old British girl named Venetia Burney did. She thought the new planet should be called Pluto, after the Roman god of the underworld.
Not all astronomers agree that Pluto should no longer be a planet. What do you think? Why?

Selective breeding, also called artificial selection, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new varieties of various species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species. The characteristics of a species can be used to classify the species. This is sometimes difficult to do.
Genetic engineering is also called genetic modification (or
). It is not the same as cloning. Although cloning techniques are used in genetic engineering, the two things should not be confused.
The table shows some of the differences.
Certain enzymes can cut pieces of DNA containing a particular gene from one organism, and join them into a gap in the DNA of another organism. This means that the new organism with the inserted genes has the genetic information for one or more new characteristics. For example, the organism might produce a useful substance, or be able to carry out a new function. We say that the organism has been genetically modified.
The animation shows how the method can be used to produce bacteria that produce insulin. This is a human hormone and valuable to people with diabetes. Bacteria reproduce quickly, so a lot of insulin can be made quickly.

2521	5	"Who am I? - Characteristics and inheritance
Some characteristics are caused by the environment, some by inherited factors, while some are caused by both environment and inherited factors.
Male mammals carry XY sex chromosomes - female mammals carry XX sex chromosomes. Inherited disorders are caused by faulty genes on these chromosomes.
Different versions of a gene are called alleles, and these alleles can be dominant or recessive. Genetic diagrams can show the possible outcomes of a particular cross.
Some characteristics of an individual are caused by the environment. For example, the language we use, or whether we have scars, are environmental characteristics. Other characteristics are inherited.
Some characteristics - including intelligence, body mass and height - are the result of both environmental and inherited factors. But there is debate about the relative importance of the two types of factor in some human characteristics, such as intelligence, health and sporting ability.
In humans and other mammals, gender is controlled by a pair of sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes, XX. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, XY.
. You can tell what a characteristic is like by studying the results of breeding experiments.
Gregor Mendel, a German monk, carried out experiments with pea plants in the 19th century. He had pea plants that had only produced red flowers for several generations, and pea plants that had only produced white flowers for several generations. When he bred the red-flowering plants with the white-flowering plants, all the offspring produced red flowers. Mendel was able to show that red flowers in pea plants is a dominant characteristic, and white flowers in pea plants is a recessive characteristic.

Alleles are different versions of the same gene. An allele can be dominant or recessive. Individuals, meanwhile, can be homozygous or heterozygous:

A recessive characteristic will only be shown if an individual is homozygous for the recessive allele. A dominant characteristic will be shown even if an individual is heterozygous for the dominant allele.
Genetic diagrams are used to show the possible outcomes of a particular cross. A dominant allele is shown by a capital letter, and a recessive allele by a lower case letter.
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder caused by a recessive allele. This genetic diagram shows the possible outcomes when both parents are heterozygous for the faulty allele. There is a one in four chance of the offspring being homozygous for the faulty allele, and so having cystic fibrosis.
This genetic diagram shows the possible outcomes when only one parent carries the faulty allele. There is no chance of the offspring being homozygous for the faulty allele, and so having cystic fibrosis.
Huntington’s disorder is caused by a dominant allele. This genetic diagram shows the possible outcomes when one parent is heterozygous for the faulty allele. There is a one in two chance of the offspring carrying the faulty allele, and so having Huntington’s disorder.

2406	5	"Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons. These are separated into useful products, such as fuels, using a process called fractional distillation.
The demand for short hydrocarbon molecules is greater than their supply in crude oil, so a reaction called cracking is used. Cracking converts long alkane molecules into shorter alkanes and alkenes, which are more useful. The exploitation of oil can damage the environment - for example, through oil spills.

If some of the rocks above the oil are impermeable, the oil cannot rise through them, so it gets trapped underneath.
Distillation is a process that can be used to separate a pure liquid from a mixture of liquids. It works when the liquids have different boiling points. Distillation is commonly used to

Step 1 - water and ethanol solution are heated

Step 2 - the ethanol evaporates first, cools, then condenses
Distillation process to separate ethanol from water
Step 3 - the water left evaporates, cools, then condenses
The mixture is heated in a flask. Ethanol has a lower boiling point than water so it evaporates first. The ethanol vapour is then cooled and condensed inside the condenser to form a pure liquid. The thermometer shows the boiling point of the pure ethanol liquid. When all the ethanol has evaporated from the solution, the temperature rises and the water evaporates.
This is the sequence of events in distillation:
heating    →    evaporating    →    cooling    →    condensing
Fractional distillation differs from distillation only in that it separates a mixture into a number of different parts, called fractions. A tall column is fitted above the mixture, with several condensers coming off at different heights. The column is hot at the bottom and cool at the top. Substances with high boiling points condense at the bottom, and substances with low boiling points condense at the top. Like distillation, fractional distillation works because the different substances in the mixture have different boiling points.
Because they have different boiling points, the substances in crude oil can be separated using fractional distillation. The crude oil is evaporated, and its vapours allowed to condense at different temperatures in the fractionating column. Each fraction contains hydrocarbon molecules with a similar number of carbon atoms.
The diagram below summarises the main fractions from crude oil, their uses, and the trends in properties. Note that the gases condense at the top of the column, the liquids in the middle, while the solids stay at the bottom.
Here are the main fractions in list. They are in increasing order from small molecules - gases - to large ones.
- contains propane and butane, used in bottled cooking gas
- fuel for ships and power stations
Hydrocarbons with small molecules make better fuels than hydrocarbons with large molecules, because they are volatile, flow easily, and are easily ignited.
Geologists can often tell where oil is trapped by looking at the structure of the rocks. Oil tends to be trapped where rocks are domed upwards, or where permeable rocks are in contact with impermeable rocks at a fault line.
Oil companies can drill down through the impermeable rocks to get it out. They are then able to turn the oil into products we can use.

Crude oil takes millions of years to form, and we are using it up more quickly than it is created. Present estimates suggest world supplies of crude oil will run out in about 30 years, unless we use it more efficiently. There are additional reserves of oil in rocks called oil shale. However, it is expensive to extract oil from oil shale because it needs to be heated to release the oil.
Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and land
Oil is carried from oil fields to refineries using ocean-going tankers. If the oil is spilled, it causes considerable damage to the environment:
oil slicks travel across the sea, far from the original spill
beaches and wildlife are harmed when they are coated with oil

molecules are not efficient. They do not flow easily, and are difficult to ignite. Crude oil often contains too many large hydrocarbon molecules, and not enough small hydrocarbon molecules, to meet demand. This is where
Cracking allows large hydrocarbon molecules to be broken down into smaller alkane and alkene molecules:
smaller hydrocarbons are more useful as fuels
alkenes are useful, because they are used to make polymers
Fractions containing large hydrocarbon molecules are vaporised and passed over a hot catalyst. This breaks chemical bonds in the molecules, and forms smaller hydrocarbon molecules.

(France: 1834) argued that symptoms were irrelevant, and that what was happening inside the body was much more important when it came to diagnosing illness. As a result, doctors made diagnoses on the basis of a full clinical examination of the 'signs' made by the disease on the body.

(Germany: 1890s) reasoned that, if certain dyes could stain bacteria, perhaps certain chemicals could kill them. He set up a private laboratory and a team of scientists. By 1914 they had discovered several 'magic bullets' - compounds that would have a specific attraction to disease-causing microorganisms in the body, and that would target and kill them. These were methylene blue (for malaria), trypan red (for sleeping sickness) and Salvarsan (for syphilis) - although Salvarsan was more effective than the other two.

Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water
Remember that the equation for photosynthesis is:
carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)
Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a

Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water.
Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots.
The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

The velocity of an object is its speed in a particular direction. The slope on a velocity-time graph represents the acceleration of an object. The distance travelled is equal to the area under a velocity-time graph.
You should recall from your Key Stage 3 studies how to calculate the speed of an object from the distance travelled and the time taken.
When an object moves in a straight line at a steady speed, you can calculate its speed if you know how far it travels and how long it takes. This equation shows the relationship between speed, distance travelled and time taken:
For example, a car travels 300 metres in 20 seconds.
Its speed is 300 ÷ 20 = 15m/s.

You should be able to draw and explain distance-time graphs for objects moving at steady speeds or standing still.
The vertical axis of a distance-time graph is the distance travelled from the start. The horizontal axis is the time from the start.
When an object is stationary, the line on the graph is horizontal. When an object is moving at a steady speed, the line on the graph is straight, but sloped.
The diagram shows some typical lines on a distance-time graph.
Note that the steeper the line, the greater the speed of the object. The blue line is steeper than the red because it represents an object moving faster than the one represented by the red line.

The velocity of an object is its speed in a particular direction. This means that two cars travelling at the same speed, but in opposite directions, have different velocities.
The vertical axis of a velocity-time graph is the velocity of the object. The horizontal axis is the time from the start.
When an object is moving with a constant velocity, the line on the graph is horizontal. When an object is moving with a constant acceleration, the line on the graph is straight, but sloped. The diagram shows some typical lines on a velocity-time graph.
The steeper the line, the greater the acceleration of the object. The blue line is steeper than the red line because it represents an object with a greater acceleration.

When an object moves in a straight line with a constant acceleration, you can calculate its acceleration if you know how much its velocity changes and how long this takes. This equation shows the relationship between acceleration, change in velocity and time taken:
For example, a car accelerates in 5s from 25m/s to 35m/s.
Its velocity changes by 35 - 25 = 10m/s.
So its acceleration is 10 ÷ 5 = 2m/s

Its acceleration is 8 ÷ 4 = 2m/s
The area under the line in a velocity-time graph represents the distance travelled. To find the distance travelled in the graph above, we need to find the area of the light-blue triangle and the dark-blue rectangle.
The width of the triangle is 4 seconds and the height is 8 metres per second. To find the area, you use the equation:
so the area of the light-blue triangle is
The width of the rectangle is 6 seconds and the height is 8 metres per second. So the area is 8 × 6 = 48m.
The area of the light-blue triangle plus the area of the dark-blue rectangle is:

336	3	"On a December morning, shortly before dawn, Danny Thompson, age 10, looked through a small telescope. He saw a round red disk-Mars. ""Someday I will go to Mars,"" Danny said later.
Over the years, many people have dreamed of going to Mars. The day when travel to Mars is possible is coming closer. Robot spacecraft have already traveled there. Those spacecraft have made many amazing discoveries.
The most recent spacecraft to journey to the fourth rock from the sun is
. It started orbiting the red planet more than a year ago.
Recent photos taken by Mars Odyssey show that Mars has water. Because it is very cold on Mars, the water is frozen. Most of the water is frozen under the surface of Mars.
Even though lots of ice crystals are mixed in with the Martian soil, Mars doesn't have as much water as Earth has. Mars has lakes of water, not oceans of water. In fact, scientists say that if you collected all the water on Mars, it would fill a lake about twice the size of Lake Michigan.
There is evidence that some of the frozen water locked under the surface of Mars might melt every once in a while. Some of the water is only 18 inches below the surface. Molten rock deep beneath the surface of Mars might heat the ice. The melted ice might mix with salt deposits in the Martian soil and flow down steep canyon walls.

The athletes who compete in the newly admitted Olympic sports are very excited about going to Sydney. ""It is an awesome feeling, and I don't even know how to explain it."" said Barbara Kunkel. Kunkel is a member of the U.S. tae kwon do team.
A sport must meet certain rules to become a part of the Olympic Games. Leaders of a sport must apply to be a part of the Olympics seven years before the sport can be included in any Olympic Games.
In addition, a men's sport must be ""widely practiced in at least 75 countries,"" and a women's sport must be practiced ""in at least 40 countries and on three continents.""
The United States is sending more than 200 athletes to the Games in Sydney. Those athletes are competing against athletes from more than 190 nations.
Other Summer Olympic events include track and field, swimming, baseball, and sailing.
The last Summer Olympics took place in the United States in 1996. The 1996 Games were held in Atlanta, Georgia, and the United States won 101 medals, the most won in the 1996 Games. This year, U.S. athletes, including Barbara Kunkel, are trying for a Olympic repeat.

2650	5	"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal – creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

2783	5	"There are two types of electric current - direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). An electric current can be produced by moving a magnet inside a coil of wire. The size of this induced current can be increased by moving the magnet faster, by using a stronger magnet, or by increasing the number of turns on the coil and increasing its area. A dynamo is a type of electricity generator.
There are two types of electric current:
If the current flows in only one direction it is called direct current, or DC. Batteries and solar cells supply DC electricity. A typical battery may supply 1.5V. The diagram shows an oscilloscope screen displaying the signal from a DC supply.
If the current constantly changes direction it is called alternating current, or AC. Mains electricity is an AC supply. The UK mains supply is about 230V. It has a frequency of 50Hz (50 hertz), which means that it changes direction and back again 50 times a second. The diagram shows an oscilloscope screen displaying the signal from an AC supply.
You should know how to produce an electric current using a coil of wire and a magnet.
An electric current is produced when a magnet is moved into a coil of wire in a circuit. We say that the electric current has been induced, and the process is called induction. The direction of the induced current is reversed when the magnet is moved out of the coil again. It can also be reversed if the other pole of the magnet is moved into the coil. Check your understanding of this with this simulation.

Notice that no current is induced when the magnet is still, even if it is inside the coil.
increase the number of turns on the coil
It is not practical to generate large amounts of electricity by passing a magnet in and out of a coil of wire. Instead, generators induce a current by spinning a coil of wire inside a magnetic field, or by spinning a magnet inside a coil of wire. As this happens, a potential difference - voltage - is produced between the ends of the coil, which causes a current to flow.
One simple example of a generator is the bicycle dynamo. The dynamo has a wheel that touches the back tyre. As the bicycle moves, the wheel turns a magnet inside a coil. This induces enough electricity to run the bicycle's lights.

Cad é mar atá tú? Tá mé féin go maith mar tá mé ar laethanta saoire sa Spáinn. Tá mé anseo le mo theaghlach.
Tháinig muid ar an eitleán. Bhí sé ar fheabhas mar ní raibh mé ar eitleán riamh.
Tá muid ag stopadh in óstán cois farraige. Tá an seomra measartha beag ach tá sé glan agus compordach. Tá linn snámha taobh amuigh den óstán.
Chuaigh mé ag snámh san fharraige maidin inné agus chuaigh muid amach go dtí bialann aréir - fuair muid béile iontach deas.
Beidh muid ar ais i gceann seachtaine - ar an 20ú Iúil. Feicfidh mé thú ansin.
A good piece of writing at this level will:
Think about why Lára's answer is good. Compare your answer with hers and then move on to the next page to see the teacher's view.
Here are the teacher's comments. The teacher is looking for answers that make sense and give all the information asked for, with some development of tasks to reach the required word limit. Correct use of tenses is important as well.
Firstly, Lára is writing a postcard, so she needs to lay it out properly. She did this - giving an address, an opening and a closing statement. She then goes about fulfilling the main tasks, developing answers where appropriate.
Tá mé féin go maith mar tá mé ar laethanta saoire sa Spáinn. Tá mé anseo le mo theaghlach.
She says she travelled by plane and added a nice sentence saying why she enjoyed this - she had never been on a plane before. ""
Bhí sé ar fheabhas mar ní raibh mé ar eitleán riamh.
Lára tells us she is staying in a hotel by the sea - ""
Tá muid ag stopadh in óstán cois farraige.
"" She develops this task by telling us more about the hotel. This is a good idea. ""
Tá an seomra measartha beag ach tá sé glan agus compordach. Tá linn snámha taobh amuigh den óstán
."" She uses the present tense correctly as well..
Lára also correctly uses the plural form ""
"" (We are). She mentioned that she is on holiday with her family, it is more natural to use this plural form - We are staying / We came on the plane etc.
Mention two things you have done so far
Chuaigh muid ag snámh san fharraige maidin inné agus chuaigh muid amach go dtí bialann aréir - fuair muid béile iontach deas.
Two nice sentences using the past tense.
Lára says she will be back in a week's time and gives a date - this is a good idea.
Beidh muid ar ais i gceann seachtaine - ar an 20ú Iúil.
Correct use of the future tense here. She also finishes using a nice natural phrase suitable for talking to her friend. ""
"" and signs off her postcard - ""
You could plan your answer - writing a brief diagram or plan first will help focus your ideas.
Think about material you have prepared for your Presentation / Conversation - is any of it useful here?
Writing each task as a separate paragraph is a good way to organise your answer.
Try to keep the information in sequence - it helps to make sure everything has been covered and makes it easier to mark!
Use a suitable writing style - a
letter will need a date / address / an opening and a closing statement.
will not need any of these. Do not write a letter if asked for an account and vice versa.
Is it clear and easy to understand with no repetition of language?
Have you checked spelling and grammar structures?
Are the tenses used the correct ones? You will usually need to include the
Have you given an opinion / preference or point of view?
Have you developed the tasks where appropriate by adding some extra information?
Have you stuck to the word limit - not gone under and not gone over by too many words?
Have you covered every task asked for? It is a good idea to tick each one off when completed.
Be sure to treat each task equally as they all carry equal marks.
Write a postcard to a friend including the following information. (approx. 90-100 words).
Say why you like the place (food / people / things to do etc.)
Say when you will see your friend when you come home
Cad é an chraic leat? Tá mé anseo sa Fhrainc ar laethanta saoire. Tá mé anseo le mo thuismitheoirí agus mo dheartháir Pól.
Tháinig muid ar an bhád - níor thaitin an turas liom mar bhí sé rófhada agus bhí mé tinn! Ach tá mé ceart go leor anois.
Tá an aimsir ar fheabhas - bíonn an ghrian ag soilsiú gach lá - ach bíonn sé róthe in amanna.
Is breá liom an áit mar tá neart le déanamh ag daoine óga. Tá na daoine iontach cairdiúil agus tá an bia blasta fosta.
Beidh mé anseo ar feadh cúpla lá eile. Feicfidh mé thú ag an dioscó oíche Aoine.
A Sheáin a chara, Cad é an chraic leat?
Did you begin with a greeting or opening phrase? There are many you can choose from eg.
Cad é mar atá tú? Cad é mar atá an saol? Tá súil agam go bhfuil tú go maith.
Tá mé anseo sa Fhrainc ar laethanta saoire. Tá mé anseo le mo thuismitheoirí agus mo dheartháir Pól.
Did you use the present tense to say where you are. Eoghan also gives some extra information about who he's with - this is a good idea.
Tháinig muid ar an bhád - níor thaitin an turas liom mar bhí sé rófhada agus bhí mé tinn! Ach tá mé ceart go leor anois.
Eoghan uses the past tense correctly to say how he travelled and he develops the task to say that the journey was too long and he was ill - this shows very good use of language.
Tá an aimsir ar fheabhas - bíonn an ghrian ag soilsiú gach lá - ach bíonn sé róthe in amanna.
Eoghan uses the present tense correctly to talk about the weather. He uses some nice phrases to describe weather. Try to develop your answers like this - a general statement about the weather and then something more specific - eg. sun shining every day / it's too hot.
Is breá liom an áit mar tá neart le déanamh ag daoine óga. Tá na daoine iontach cairdiúil agus tá an bia blasta fosta.
Eoghan gives some excellent reasons why he likes the place in which he is staying and again uses the present tense.
Beidh mé anseo ar feadh cúpla lá eile. Feicfidh mé thú ag an dioscó oíche Aoine.
The future tense is used here to make an arrangement to meet up later.
Eoghan ends his postcard with an appropriate phrase -
/ all the best. There are many different ways of signing off eg.
Le grá / Slán go fóill / Slán / Ádh mór
- all of these add a bit of style to your writing.
This is an excellent piece of writing at this level.
Sentences are accurate and easy to understand.
It has answered the question in full and covered all five tasks asked for.
There is evidence of development of tasks - extra information added when appropriate.
It has only gone slightly over the word limit.
The correct tenses are used and a good range of vocabulary included.

It has been much the same, but nevertheless now contains more nitrogen and oxygen, and less carbon dioxide, than it did when the earth first formed. Recently, the addition of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels has lead to global warming.
It is difficult to predict, even by using computer models, exactly what the mean temperature of the Earth will be in the future. However it seems sensible to limit global warming and protect the environment, through sustainable development and by reducing waste, wherever possible.
Scientists believe that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Its early atmosphere was probably formed from the gases given out by volcanoes. It is believed that there was intense volcanic activity for the first billion years of the Earth's existence.
The early atmosphere was probably mostly carbon dioxide, with little or no oxygen. There were small quantities of water vapour, ammonia and methane. As the Earth cooled down, most of the water vapour condensed and formed the oceans.
So how did the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go down, and the proportion of oxygen go up?
The proportion of oxygen went up because of photosynthesis by plants.
The proportion of carbon dioxide went down because:
it was locked up in sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, and in fossil fuels
it was absorbed by plants for photosynthesis
The burning of fossil fuels is adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere faster than it can be removed. This means that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing.

type of pterosaur that lived millions of years ago. To be extinct means to have died out completely.
(nem-i-coh-LOP-ter-uss CRIP-ti-cuss). It is little, but it may set a big record. Scientists say it is the smallest toothless pterosaur ever found!
. A wingspan is the distance from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. The reptile also had a sharp, pointy beak and curved, birdlike claws.
The reptile's small size may have had advantages. Scientists say being small may have allowed
to hide from animals that eat other animals. Its size may have also helped it find food. Because it was small, the reptile could ""be [quicker] to catch insects,"" scientist Xiaolin Wang told
. Wang was on the team that discovered the pterosaur.
Scientists plan to study the reptile's fossil in more detail. They hope it will offer clues about how pterosaurs changed over time. ""They are ancestors of the large pterosaurs,"" Wang says.
Pterosaurs ranged in size from as small as a bird to as big as an airplane. Here are three different kinds of pterosaurs.
This pterosaur's wingspan was about 4 feet. It also had a huge head, and its legs could stretch out.
This pterosaur was about 6 feet long with a wingspan of 20 to 25 feet.
This is the largest pterosaur ever found. Its wingspan was about 40 feet. It also had a long, thin beak.
Why might scientists want to study pterosaurs?

2368	5	"Explain the reasons for the downfall of Terence O'Neill.
Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it.
Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve.
The answer will be general providing some information related to the question but it will not adequately explain the reasons for O'Neill's resignation.
The answer will discuss some of the reasons for the downfall of O'Neill but lack sufficient depth.
The answer will show that the candidate is aware that O'Neill had lost the support of both nationalists and unionists and it will clearly outline the reasons for this.
Terence O'Neill was Prime Minister of Northern Ireland from 1963 to 1969. He led the Unionist Party during these years. He brought in many reforms which did not really satisfy nationalists who wanted major changes. There were protest marches and street violence during the years 1968 and 1969 and as a result O'Neill resigned in April 1969.
Paul would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate's answer is too general. Some reasons for O'Neill's downfall have been included but these needed to be explained more fully.
Terence O'Neill was forced to resign in 1969. He had lost the support of nationalists and unionists over his government's handling of the Civil Rights Movement and the protest marches which they had organised. Although O'Neill had brought in a Five-Point Reform programme and had sought to improve relations with the Republic of Ireland, nationalists felt his reforms did not go far enough. Following some bomb explosions in 1969 he resigned.
Glenn would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate has provided an answer of reasonable quality but it lacks balance. It provides some reasons to explain why nationalists were unhappy with O'Neill's leadership but fails to explain why many unionists were also dissatisfied.
Terence O'Neill resigned in April 1969 having lost the support of many nationalists and unionists. As early as 1965 Dr. Ian Paisley, following O'Neill's meetings with the Irish Taoiseach Sean Lemass, had started an ""O'Neill Must Go"" campaign. Many unionists had become increasingly unhappy with O'Neill's reforms which they saw as concessions to nationalists and they felt he was taking N. Ireland closer to a United Ireland. He had major critics, Faulkner, Craig and Chichester-Clark within his own Party, who disagreed with him over his reforms and resigned from his government.
O'Neill was also heavily criticized by nationalists for his reluctance to bring in reforms such as ""One Man, One Vote"" and for his Government's handling of the civil rights marches in October 1968 and January 1969 when marchers had been attacked.
His growing unpopularity was clearly revealed by the limited support shown for pro-O'Neill candidates in the February election of 1969. Following some UVF explosions at water pumping stations in the spring of 1969, O'Neill decided to resign.
Nuala would get a level 3 for this answer. The candidate has produced a high quality response. It clearly outlines how O'Neill had alienated many nationalists and unionists and reveals that the campaign to oust him had started as early as 1965. It also explains how the lack of support for O'Neill had become very evident in the early months of 1969.

2605	5	"The atmosphere has not always been the same. It has been much the same, but nevertheless now contains more nitrogen and oxygen, and less carbon dioxide, than it did when the earth first formed. Recently, the addition of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels has lead to global warming.
It is difficult to predict, even by using computer models, exactly what the mean temperature of the Earth will be in the future. However it seems sensible to limit global warming and protect the environment, through sustainable development and by reducing waste, wherever possible.

The early atmosphere was probably mostly carbon dioxide, with little or no oxygen. There were small quantities of water vapour, ammonia and methane. As the Earth cooled down, most of the water vapour condensed and formed the oceans.
So how did the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go down, and the proportion of oxygen go up?
The proportion of oxygen went up because of photosynthesis by plants.
The proportion of carbon dioxide went down because:
it was locked up in sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, and in fossil fuels
it was absorbed by plants for photosynthesis
The burning of fossil fuels is adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere faster than it can be removed. This means that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing.
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs heat energy and prevents it escaping into space. This keeps the Earth warm enough for liquid water and living things to exist on it. Greenhouse gases are not a bad thing in themselves. But too much of them in the atmosphere leads to global warming, where the average temperature of the Earth rises quickly.
Carbon dioxide is produced by burning fossil fuels. Because of this, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased, especially in the last one hundred years.
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th century
As the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased, so too has the average global temperature. Notice that the temperature has increased a lot from around 1860, when the increase in concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to be clear.
The temperature of the earth has risen over the years
It has taken a long time for it to be generally accepted that the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a cause of global warming. There has been uncertainty in some of the data but this has reduced as more data has been collected. Computer models help us to predict that an increase of only a few degrees will cause changes to the Earth's climate. This is why it is important to attempt to combat global warming, for example by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.
A mountain of household and industrial rubbish
Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.
Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even
common household items can contain toxic chemicals
such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.
Industrial waste is also discharged onto the land
chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage crops
to improve their crops, but these can damage living things. Toxic chemicals can be washed from the land into rivers, lakes and seas.
Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and land
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas.

The resources on the Earth are limited. It is important that the things we do now do not make things difficult or impossible for future generations. To achieve sustainable development, we need to balance these things carefully:
the need for economic development, where standards of living improve
respect for the environment and the resources it provides for us
Recycling is an important way to help us achieve sustainable development. We can recycle many resources, including:
Glass is easily recycled. It can be melted and remoulded to make new objects, such as bottles. The energy needed to do this is less than the energy needed to make new glass from its raw materials. However, we need to sort different coloured glass ready for recycling, and transport it to the recycling plant.
Just like glass, it takes less energy to melt and remould metals than it does to extract new metals from their ores. Aluminium is a valuable metal that melts at a relatively low temperature, and is particularly attractive for recycling. However, a lot of metals that we use are mixtures called alloys, and it can be difficult to sort different metals ready for recycling.
Paper is not melted when it is recycled. Instead, it is broken up into small pieces and reformed to make new sheets of paper. This takes less energy to do than making paper from trees. However, paper can only be recycled a few times before its fibres become too short to be useful, and the recycled paper is often only good enough for toilet paper or cardboard. But it can be used as a fuel or compost instead.

2811	5	"A lot of everyday items are made from polymers. Many of these polymers are not biodegradable - microbes cannot digest them and they take a long time to break down. Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.
The properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex® have more useful properties than other polymers.
Polymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).
. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:
ethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythene
a typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottle
a typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packaging
Some polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.
One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.
Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.
Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.
Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are
Many polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.
Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.
Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex® has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex® is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon® is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex®.
Gore-Tex® contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
Gore-TexÂ® fabric is a sandwich of materials
Structure and properties of polymers - higher
Strong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:
the strength of the forces between these molecules
A polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the material’s melting point.
Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.
Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.
Vulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.

294	3	"This map shows where Mount Vesuvius is located.
(veh-SOO-vee-uhss) majestically stands over the Italian landscape. The scenic mountain rises 4,200 feet high southeast of the city of Naples, which is located in southern Italy. But many people living in this region fear Mount Vesuvius. That's because it is an active volcano.
Nearly 2,000 years ago, Vesuvius exploded with tremendous force. Deadly smoke, gases, and rock shot more than 9 miles high in the air. That is about one and a half times the height of Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain.
A thick black cloud engulfed the region and blocked out the sun. An avalanche of boiling
poured from the volcano at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Lava is melted rock from a volcano.
The explosion sealed the ancient city of Pompeii (pahm-PAY) under a blanket of rock and ash. A mudslide wiped out the nearby town of Herculaneum (her-kyuh-LAY-nee-uhm). Many people died as a result of the volcano's fury.
Although many eruptions have occurred since then, Vesuvius hasn't exploded with such force since that devastating day. The last major eruption occurred in 1944.
Scientists warn, though, that it's only a matter of time before Mount Vesuvius erupts with tremendous force again. ""It won't be tomorrow, it won't be next month, and maybe it won't be next year,"" a scientist who monitors the volcano told
. ""But [Vesuvius] is overdue [to explode].""
Today, nearly 600,000 people live in the 18 towns surrounding Vesuvius. This high-risk area is known as the ""red zone.""
Officials estimate that they would need two weeks to evacuate all the people living in the red zone. According to scientists, anything within 4 miles of Vesuvius could be destroyed during the first 15 minutes of an eruption.
The volcano's past, however, hasn't stopped people from moving into the area. In fact, Italian officials are concerned about the overcrowding of people in the red zone. To encourage people to move away from this area, they have put a plan in place.
Some families are being offered $36,000 to move to safer locations. The goal is to persuade about 150,000 families to move from the area near the volcano within the next 15 years.
In 1995, the government also created a national park near the top of Vesuvius. That limits the number of people living there.
""Vesuvius is the most dangerous volcano in the world on account of the number of people living under it,"" said the president of the Naples region. ""The smaller the population, the smaller the danger Vesuvius represents.""

Sub-atomic particles with a positive charge and a relative mass of 1.

The relative mass is the number of times heavier a particle is, compared to another.
So small as to be not worth considering.
mass. Neutrons are neutral, but protons and electrons are electrically charged. Protons have a relative charge of +1 and electrons have a relative charge of -1.
All elements are made of atoms. An atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons.
. The Greek philosopher Demokritos (460-370 BCE) maintained that all matter could be divided and sub-divided into smaller and smaller units, and eventually there would be a tiny particle that could not be divided any further - an atom. This was remarkable because there was no way ancient Greeks could support this theory by observation or experiment.
Understanding of atoms didn’t progress much beyond Demokritos’ theory until the English chemist John Dalton (1766 - 1844) started to look at it in the 1800s. Dalton did experiments, worked out some atomic weights, and invented symbols for atoms and
a collection of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. The fundamental unit of compounds
. His most important conclusions are summarised below.
all matter is made of atoms, and atoms are indestructible and cannot be broken down into pieces
all the atoms of a particular element are identical to each other and different from the atoms of other elements
atoms are rearranged in a chemical reaction
compounds are formed when two or more different kinds of atoms join together
Molecules of oxygen - the two atoms are joined by a double bond
A molecule of carbon dioxide. Atoms are represented as spheres and are colour-coded - carbon (green) and oxygen (red). The atoms are joined by double bonds
Dalton's theories about atoms took a long time to be accepted by scientists. Some of his ideas about gases were incorrect, and it was difficult for many years to do the experiments needed to support his theories, because atoms are too small to see.
Although the word 'atom' comes from the Greek for indivisible, we now know that atoms are not the smallest particles of matter. Instead, they have a small central nucleus surrounded by even smaller particles called electrons.
All substances are made from atoms. And, as Dalton suggested, any given element is made of atoms of just one particular sort. The atoms of any element are different from the atoms of any other element. So iron contains a different sort of atoms from those of sulfur, and the atoms in carbon are different from those of oxygen.
The atoms of each element are represented by chemical symbols. These usually consist of one or two different letters, but sometimes three letters are used for newly-discovered elements. The first letter in a chemical symbol is always an
letter, and the other letters are always
. So, the symbol for magnesium is
Every element has its own chemical symbol. For example, iron is
There are more than 100 different elements. The periodic table is a chart showing all the elements arranged in a particular way. The vertical columns in the periodic table are called groups. Each group contains elements that have similar properties.
. For example, group 1 contains very reactive metals such as sodium -
- while group 7 contains very reactive non-metals such as chlorine -
Note that you will never find a compound in the periodic table, because these consist of two or more different elements joined together by chemical bonds.
New substances are formed by chemical reactions. When elements react together to form compounds their atoms join to other atoms using chemical bonds. For example, iron and sulfur - often spelt 'sulphur' - react together to form a compound called iron sulfide - often spelt 'sulphide' - and sodium and oxygen react together to form sodium oxide.
Mixture of iron (grey) and sulphur (yellow) powders.
The mixture is heated in a test tube.
A chemical reaction occurs and iron sulphide is formed.
Chemical bonds involve electrons from the reacting atoms. Bonds can form when:
, so that one atom gives electrons and the other takes electrons, or
You don’t need to know any more details about these bonds for GCSE Science.
The chemical formula of a compound shows how many of each type of atom join together to make the units that make the compound up. For example, in iron sulfide every iron atom is joined to one sulfur atom, so we show its formula as
. In sodium oxide, there are two sodium atoms for every oxygen atom, so we show its formula as Na
O. Notice that the 2 is written as a subscript, so Na2O would be wrong.
The diagram below shows that one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms combine to make up the units of carbon dioxide - its chemical formula should therefore be written as CO
Carbon dioxide units contain one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms
Sometimes you see more complex formulae such as Na
contains two sodium atoms, one sulfur atom and four oxygen atoms joined together
contains one iron atom, three oxygen atoms and three hydrogen atoms - the brackets show that the 3 applies to
When elements are joined to cause a chemical reaction, no atoms are made or lost during the process - but at the end of it they are joined differently from the way they were at the start. This means that the mass of the substances at the start -
- is the same as the mass of the substances at the end -
Copper and oxygen reaction - getting a balanced equation
to show what happens to the different atoms in reactions. For example, copper and oxygen react together to make copper oxide.
copper + oxygen    →    copper oxide
You can see that copper and oxygen are the reactants, and copper oxide is the product.
Notice that we have unequal numbers of each type of atom on the left-hand side compared with the right-hand side. To make things equal, we need to adjust the number of units of some of the substances until we get equal numbers of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow.
You can see that now we have two copper atoms and two oxygen atoms on each side. This matches what happens in the reaction.
Two atoms of copper react with two atoms of oxygen to form two molecules of copper oxide

The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims.
Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""I’m almost there. I’m almost there.""
His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!""
Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land.
Johnny didn’t only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

2257	5	"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal – creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

Carbohydrates and fats are high energy sources. Protein, meanwhile, is needed for growth and repair. Protein deficiency leads to diseases such as kwashiorkor.

Proteins are also used as an 'emergency' energy source if the diet has insufficient carbohydrates and fats in it.

vitamins, such as vitamin C, which prevents a disease called scurvy
In warm weather, or when you are not doing much exercise, you do not need to eat as much food as when it is cold, or when you have exerted yourself physically. If you eat too much food without taking enough exercise, you will become overweight, with very overweight people being described as obese. Overweight people may suffer from health problems, including:
diabetes - an illness in which the body is unable to control the amount of sugar in the blood
arthritis - an illness in which the joints become worn, inflamed and painful
Teenagers are growing quickly and need plenty of protein. But people in developing countries may not get enough protein in their diet. This is called

You can calculate the recommended daily average (RDA) intake of protein using this formula:
RDA in g = 0.75 × body mass in kg
What is the protein RDA for a person with a body mass of 60kg?
RDA = 0.75 × 60 = 45g
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a guide to whether someone is underweight, normal weight or overweight. You can calculate the BMI using this formula:
BMI = mass in kg ÷ (height in m)
What is the BMI of a 1.7 metre-tall person with a body mass of 60kg?
In this example, the person would be at the ideal weight for their height.
The food we eat consists of large lumps of material. We must bite off small pieces and chew them up into even smaller parts, before swallowing them. When the food gets into our stomach it is broken down further as it is squeezed and moved around by the stomach’s muscular walls. This is

The substances which our body needs cannot be absorbed into the blood until they have been broken down into small, soluble chemicals. This process is called
, and it works with the help of enzymes. Once the food is completely digested, its molecules are small enough to pass through the wall of the small intestine by diffusion.
Nutrients and the enzymes that digest them
Chemical digestion occurs in the mouth, stomach and small intestine. In the stomach, stomach acid helps the enzymes to work.
Bile is an alkaline substance produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. It is secreted into the small intestine, where it emulsifies fats. This is important, because it provides a larger surface area in which the lipases can work.

In 1999, about 3? million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates.
The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall.
Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.
Follow these safety tips when playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates:
Learn how to use the toy the correct way.
If a move seems dangerous, do not try it!
Do not play with the toy outside at night.

shows that about 17,000 school bus–related accidents occur each year. That’s more than double previous estimates. Those injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers reported that crashes aren’t causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.
The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldn’t reduce injuries and wouldn’t be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

""This is a piece of history,"" said Bruce Danks, who worked on the bus.
On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a seamstress, boarded the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, on her way home from work. Refusing to give up her seat to a white man, Rosa Parks was arrested and sent to jail.
Her arrest sparked the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott. A boycott is a protest in which people refuse to
buy, sell, or use something. As part of the boycott, African Americans refused to ride buses in Montgomery if they couldn't sit in the front.
The Montgomery bus boycott lasted for over a year. In December 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to segregate, or separate, whites from African Americans on buses.
An ordinary woman who made an extraordinary difference, Rosa Parks is often referred to as ""the Mother of the Civil Rights Movement."" She inspired a new era of civil rights in the United States.

All living things get the energy they need to live from a chemical reaction called

is the chemical reaction used to release energy from glucose. It is called aerobic because oxygen from the air is also needed.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration. Energy is put in brackets because it not a substance:
Notice that the word equation for respiration is the reverse of the word equation for photosynthesis. Check back if you are not sure of this.
Plant cells respire, just as animal cells do. If they stop respiring, they will die. Remember that respiration is not the same as breathing, so take care - plants do not breathe.
As we can see from the word equations respiration and photosynthesis are opposites. Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.
So what happens to a plant overall? This depends on whether it is in the dark or the light, and how bright the light is.
Plants respire all the time, whether it is dark or light. They photosynthesise only when they are in the light.
Neither gas is taken in or given out, as each cancels the other out
Photosynthesis usually results in a net food gain (net glucose gain), once respiration has been accounted for. This means that there is an increase in the biomass of the plant.
Plants that lose their leaves in winter store food produced during the summer by photosynthesis. They store enough food to last them over winter, and to provide energy reserves for new growth in the spring.

Second, the more a company produces the lower the average cost per product will be of overheads (fixed costs, such as buildings). Where similar companies locate together as an industry they can also experience economies of scale. They share the costs of building the necessary infrastructure (eg roads, telecommunications) and the cost of educating the workforce, between them. Also the combined demand from all these companies should mean that supplies are cheaper.

An absence of strictly enforced international laws means that TNCs may operate in LEDCs in a way that would not be allowed in an MEDC. They may pollute the environment, run risks with safety or impose poor working conditions and low wages on local workers.
Globalisation is viewed by many as a threat to the world's cultural diversity. It is feared it might drown out local economies, traditions and languages and simply re-cast the whole world in the mould of the capitalist North and West.

2260	5	"The evolution of hormones and the nervous system
During evolution, humans developed certain characteristics that gave them a better chance of survival. Multicellular organisms need ways for their cells to communicate, and there are a number of different means by which the body achieves this.
Humans did not evolve from apes such as gorillas and chimps. Instead, humans and apes share a common ancestor that lived millions of years ago. This common ancestor diverged over time to form many different species of
, only one of which survived to become modern humans. All the rest of the hominids, including early humans, became
species of organism that is no longer living
During the evolution of human beings, many features gave individuals advantages that offered them a better chance of survival, including:
the ability to stand upright, so predators and prey could be seen more easily
having a larger brain, providing the ability to plan ahead, work together, and eventually speak
Ideas about science - data and theories
It has taken scientists a long time to try to discover how humans evolved. Scientists do this by producing an explanation and then looking for data to support their theory or prediction. Sometimes the data agrees with and supports the prediction. This increases the scientist’s confidence that the prediction is correct.
Data does not always support the theory
Sometimes the data disagrees and does not support the theory. This can prove that either the prediction or the observation used to produce the data is wrong. An example of this is the discovery of a new gene that affects the evolution of brain size. Scientists think it first appeared about 40,000 years ago. It has been so successful that 70% of humans now carry this gene. Scientists think that the gene increases brain size and this may improve intelligence. Scientists are now examining this gene. Many predictions and theories about how the gene works will be made, but it will only be when much more data and evidence has been collected that we will know which of these theories is correct.
In your examination you may be given additional information about human evolution that you have not seen before. You will need to be able to identify valid conclusions from the data provided and say which supports a prediction and which does not.
Data does not always prove the theory - higher only
Observations and data that support a theory still do not prove that the prediction is correct. For example, a theory that states that storks deliver human babies could be supported by the fact that populations of storks are often found near areas with higher human birth rates. This data supports the theory but does not prove it.
Observations and data that do not support a theory decrease the scientist’s confidence that the theory is correct.

Hitler introduced many policies and measures to ensure the Nazis remained in control, once he declared himself Führer. These measures dealt with political opponents, as well as ordinary people, who suddenly found their private, social and working lives controlled by the Nazis.
The Nazi party aimed to control every aspect of people's political, social and working lives. It maintained control through a mixture of
A type of advertising for an idea or cause, produced by supporters or opponents of that idea or cause. It is usually produced to influence how the people of a nation think.
The way Hitler consolidated power in 1933-1934 meant that the Nazis had absolute control of national and local government.
Hitler believed that religion was a threat to the Nazis' control over people's minds, so he tried different ways to reduce the power of the church over people.

The following points are examples of how the Nazis took control of religion:
Non-Nazi Catholic priests and Protestant pastors such as Martin Niemöller and Dietrich Bonhöffer were sent to concentration camps.
Jews and Jehovah's Witnesses were openly persecuted.
Hitler set up a state Reich Church, which banned the Bible and the cross.
Nazis encouraged people to revive the old Viking myths and ceremonies.
The Nazis dictated what people were allowed to do in their social and private lives:
Artists had to produce acceptable paintings that portrayed Nazi values.
Books written by Jews were publicly burned.
Homosexuals were persecuted; they did not fit the Nazi image of the ideal family.
The Olympic Games of 1936 were a huge Nazi propaganda success.
Measures were imposed to make sure that schools and youth associations became Nazified:
Non-Nazi teachers and university professors were sacked; teachers had to join the National Socialist Teachers' League.
Textbooks were re-written to include Nazi political and racial ideas.
There was a concentration on physical fitness.
Girls were taught cookery; boys were taught science and maths.
The Hitler Youth was compulsory; it indoctrinated boys and prepared them for war.
The Nazi Girls' youth organisation - the BDM - was compulsory; it indoctrinated girls and prepared them for church, children and cooking.
The following points are examples of how the Nazis took control of workers lives:
The RAD (National Labour Service) sent young men on public works.
Hitler introduced conscription in 1936; most men went into the army after the RAD.
The DAF (German Labour Front) controlled workers' conditions at work.
The KdF (Strength through Joy) movement regulated their leisure time.
The Nazi state intimidated and terrorised those who were opposed to it, using:

2319	5	"All religions teach the difference between good and evil, but have different beliefs about evil and suffering.
Religion has a great deal to say about 'good' and 'evil'. Religious leaders and sacred texts all encourage believers to live 'good' lives. The problem of evil and suffering is one of the commonest reasons people give for not believing in God.
- suffering caused by events that have nothing to do with humans, and which are to do with the way the world is, eg, natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, floods or earthquakes
- suffering caused by humans acting in a way that is considered morally wrong eg, bullying, murder, rape, theft or terrorism
Human evil and natural evil can often work together, with human evil making natural evil worse – or better! For example, the suffering caused by an earthquake or floods can be made worse by people looting, but it can be made more bearable by people showing compassion and making personal sacrifices to help those who are suffering.
It is important to remember that: 'evil' is a cause of suffering; 'suffering' is a result of evil.
What does Christianity teach about good and evil?
– the ability to choose between right and wrong for themselves. God has shown people how they should live (eg the Ten Commandments (a list of religious and moral rules that were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai); Jesus’ life and teaching), but it is up to them to decide whether or not to follow God’s instructions.
The story of humanity’s battle with good and evil is told in the story of Adam and Eve in the
(Genesis 3). Adam and Eve chose to disobey God by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This is called the Fall.
Some people believe that as a result of Adam and Eve’s first sins, each human is born with a tendency towards evil. This is called

44	3	"Something to Go Nuts About: New Treatment May Help Kids With Peanut Allergies
Peanuts may seem harmless, but to some kids they mean trouble. About one and a half million Americans are allergic to peanuts. Between 50 and 100 people, mostly kids, die each year from peanut allergies.
For kids with peanut allergies, help may be on the way in the form of a new drug called TNX-901. Monthly shots of TNX-901 are not a cure, but they may save lives. Results suggest that the drug reduces the chance of a serious allergic reaction if peanuts are eaten accidentally.
Eating just the tiniest amount of peanuts can make kids with peanut allergies very sick. For some of those kids, an allergic reaction can occur from just touching or smelling peanuts. Symptoms include stomach pain, hives, and tightness in the throat.
""I get an itchy rash all over my body when I eat peanuts, so I hope the new injection will help,"" said an 11-year-old girl.
It may be years before the treatment is available to the public. More testing needs to be done before the drug is approved. Researcher Donald Leung said the new drug could ""help lift a cloud of fear that people with peanut allergies live under every time they eat."" That is something that kids with peanut allergies won't find nutty.
These eight foods are the cause of most food allergies:
tree nuts (such as walnuts and cashews)
About 7 million Americans have food allergies. People can be allergic to almost any food.
If you are allergic to any food, it is important to read labels carefully. Always ask an adult if you are not sure about what is in your food.

Now I was at that time a freshwater soldier. I had not yet seen wounds made by gunshot at the first dressing. It is true that I had read in Jean de Vigo, ""Of Wounds in General"", first book, chapter eight [that the doctor should] cauterise them with oil of elder, pouring the oil as hot as possible, into the wound...
Eventually my oil ran out and I was forced to use in its place a digestive made of the yolks of eggs, rose-oil and turpentine. That night I could not sleep, fearing that because of my lack of cauterisation I would find the wounded dead or poisoned. This made me wake up very early to visit them. Beyond my hope, I found those for whom I had used the digestive feeling little pain, their wounds without inflammation, having slept fairly well through the night.

2284	5	"You should remember from your Key Stage 3 studies that white light can be split up into a spectrum of many different colours. You should know that visible light is just part of a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Different types of electromagnetic radiation have different hazards and uses.
Using a prism, you can split up white light to form a spectrum. A prism is a block of glass with a triangular cross-section. The light waves are refracted as they enter and leave the prism. The shorter the wavelength of the light, the more it is refracted. As a result, red light is refracted the least and violet light is refracted the most, causing the coloured light to spread out to form a spectrum.
Visible light is just one type of electromagnetic radiation. There are various types of electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths of light than red light and with shorter wavelengths than violet light. All the different types of electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through space.
X-rays, visible light and radio waves are all types of electromagnetic radiation.
travel at the same speed in a vacuum - empty space
The speed of electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum is 299,792,458 m/s. This is approximately three hundred million metres per second - nearly nine hundred thousand times faster than sound, which is why you see a flash of lightning before you hear the thunder.
Over-exposure to certain types of electromagnetic radiation can be harmful. The higher the frequency of the radiation, the more damage it is likely to cause to the body:
microwaves cause internal heating of body tissues
infrared radiation is felt as heat and causes skin burns
X-rays damage cells, causing mutations (which may lead to cancer) and cell death
gamma rays also damage cells, causing mutations (which may lead to cancer) and cell death
Microwave radiation can be used to transmit signals such as those for mobile phone calls. Microwave transmitters and receivers on buildings and masts communicate with the mobile phones in their range.
There is concern that microwave radiation from mobile phones and masts may be harmful to health.
Ultraviolet radiation - UV - is found naturally in sunlight. We cannot see or feel ultraviolet radiation, but our skin responds to it by turning darker. This happens as our bodies attempt to reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching deeper skin tissues. Darker skins absorb more ultraviolet light, so less ultraviolet radiation reaches the deeper tissues. This is important, because ultraviolet radiation can cause normal cells to become cancerous.
The three main types of ultraviolet radiation, and some of their effects
causes severe sunburn and damage to cells
The coloured part of your eye, the iris, has a unique pattern. Visible light reflected off the iris can be analysed by a computer and compared to stored patterns. In this way, people can be identified by their iris pattern.
All objects give off or emit infrared radiation. The hotter the object, the more infrared radiation it emits. Sensors that can detect this radiation allow the temperature of objects to be measured. This is useful for medical scans to detect abnormally hot parts of the body, which may indicate damage or illness. The detection of infrared emissions is also useful for tracking criminals at night and for military 'night vision' goggles.
Materials absorb different types of electromagnetic radiation to different degrees.
are weakly absorbed by skin and muscle, but strongly absorbed by dense material such as bone and metal. This means that X-rays can be used to produce images of bones inside your body, to check for damage such as fractures.
X-rays are also used in industry to check metal components and welds for cracks or other damage.
radiation is absorbed by water molecules, so it can be used for cooking. Water in the food absorbs the microwave radiation, which causes the water to heat up and cook the food.
Microwaves are also used to monitor rain. Satellites have been set up to measure how much microwave radiation, sent from ground-based transmitters, is absorbed by water in the atmosphere. Computers analyse the information and build up a picture of the rain and cloud.
light is used to detect forged bank notes. Certain chemicals in paper absorb ultraviolet light and emit the energy as blue light. Real bank notes have invisible markings that only show up using ultraviolet light.

2807	5	"Scientists believe that the universe began in a hot 'big bang' about 13,600 million years ago. The universe continues to expand. Stars do not remain the same but change as they age. The evidence for the Big Bang Theory includes the existence of a microwave background radiation, and red-shift.
The universe contains extremely dense objects, called black holes, and may consist mostly of dark matter that cannot be seen.
Scientists have gathered a lot of evidence and information about the universe. They have used their observations to develop a theory called the Big Bang. The theory states that about 13, 600 million years ago all the matter in the universe was concentrated into a single incredibly tiny point. This began to enlarge rapidly in a
, and it is still expanding today.
The Milky Way galaxy is home to planet Earth
Gravity is slowing down the rate of expansion. It is possible that the universe may expand for ever, or it may stop expanding. It may even contract and become very small again - the '
There are other scientific theories for the origin of the universe. For example, the
suggests that this universe is one of many - some that have existed in the past, and others that will exist in the future. When the universe contracts in a Big Crunch, a new universe is created in a new Big Bang.
suggests that as the universe expands new matter is created, so that the overall appearance of the universe never changes.
Sometimes the age of the universe is given as 13.6 billion years. This is because In scientific terms 1 billion is defined as a 1,000 million.
You should know how stars are formed.
Stars form from massive clouds of dust and gas in space
Gravity pulls the dust and gas together
As the mass falls together it gets hot. A star is formed when it is hot enough for a
to start - the hydrogen nuclei fuse together to make helium. This releases energy which keeps the core of the star hot.
During this stable phase in the life of a star, the force of gravity holding the star together is balanced by the high pressure due to the high temperatures. Our Sun is at this stable phase in its life.
The Sun is halfway through its 10 billion year stable phase
You should know that stars do not stay the same forever, and their future depends on how much mass they have.
Our sun is a type of star called a
. It has been shining for nearly five billion years, and has enough hydrogen fuel to last another five billion years. The sun and other stars eventually begin to run out of hydrogen. Gravity makes the core of the star smaller and hotter, which results in the outer layers expanding. They eventually expand so much that the star becomes a red giant star.
6.2 billion years from now the Sun will have become a red giant star
After a star becomes a red giant, what happens next depends on how massive the star is. If its mass is relatively small, gravity eventually leads to the star contracting to form a white dwarf. It fades and changes colour as it cools. The matter in a white dwarf is millions of times denser than the matter on Earth.
A white dwarf star compared to Earth
If the red giant star has enough matter, it may collapse inwards under its own force of gravity and then explode outwards, to form a supernova.
The explosion from a star forming a supernova throws dust and gas into space. This may eventually form parts of a new stars. The material left behind after the explosion forms a very dense type of star, called a neutron star (much denser than a white dwarf).
Evidence for the Big Bang - higher
There are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. Theses are
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.
This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.
Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.
A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.
A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.
The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.
Black holes and dark matter - higher
may form a neutron star. However, if enough matter is left behind, it may contract under its own gravity to become extremely dense, with such a strong gravitational field that nothing can escape from it. This includes electromagnetic radiation such as light, so it is called a black hole.
Black hole - formed when a massive star collapses
Black holes cannot be seen, but their effects on the gases from neighbouring stars can be observed. For example, X-rays are emitted when these gases spiral into a black hole.
Some of the observations of the universe, such as the spinning rates of galaxies, cannot easily be explained using our current theories about gravity. Scientists have suggested that the matter we can see – stars, planets and galaxies – are only part of the mass of the universe. They have suggested that most of the mass is actually matter we cannot see, called dark matter.
The existence of dark matter would allow scientists to explain their observations. However, some scientists doubt whether it really exists. They have suggested that our laws of gravity need tweaking to work properly when very large objects and distances are involved.

He wants to make sure that tobacco companies cannot advertise to kids. Gore also wants to make it harder for kids to buy cigarettes.

Glover calls his money Ithaca Hours. About 500 stores and businesses in Ithaca accept Ithaca Hours in exchange for goods or services. Thousands of people in Ithaca now use the local money.
One Ithaca Hour is worth $10, or an hour's worth of work. Half an Ithaca Hour is worth half as much, $5, or a half-hour of work.
Glover said that he came up with the idea to help people find work. ""All my friends have a lot of skills that were not being used, and they had a lot of time,"" he said.
Glover's idea has spread since he introduced it in 1991. People from New York to Hawaii now use their own local money instead of U.S.-issued money. At least 60 cities and towns in the United States have adopted their own local money systems.

440	3	"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

2262	5	"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal – creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

2350	5	"The decade after the Second World War saw Communism spread to the Far East, eventually dividing Korea. The Korean War lasted three years and peace was only achieved when the use of the atomic bomb was threatened.
In 1945, Korea was split along the 38th parallel between a

in the Far East. In 1949, the Communists had taken power in China. The US developed the
- the idea that, if one country fell to communism, others would follow like a row of dominoes. Then, in 1950, a report by the American National Security Council (
) recommended that the US stop containment and start to roll back communism.
In 1950, after getting the support of Russia and China, Kim IL Sung invaded South Korea.
The North Korean People's Army (NKPA) easily defeated the Republic of Korea's army (the ROKs).
By September, the NKPA had conquered almost the whole of South Korea.
The USA went to the United Nations and got them to send troops to defend South Korea.
The Russians couldn't veto the idea because they were boycotting the UN at the time.
In September, UN troops, led by the US General MacArthur, landed in Korea and drove the NKPA back.
By October, the UN forces had almost conquered all of North Korea.
In November 1950, Chinese People's Volunteers attacked and drove the Americans back.
They recaptured North Korea, and advanced into South Korea.
The Americans landed more troops and drove the Chinese back to the 38th parallel, where Truman ordered General MacArthur to stop and sacked him when he disagreed.
The war went on as border clashes until 1953 when America's new president, Eisenhower, offered peace, but threatened to use the atomic bomb if China did not accept the offer.
Recently, historians have shown that the Korean crisis
led to a third world war - many US advisers wanted to use the atomic bomb.
""Of the 16 countries contributing forces, the USA provided 50 per cent of land forces, 93 per cent of air forces, 86 per cent of naval forces. The UN gave the USA unlimited authority to direct military operations. US president Truman, not the UN, appointed General MacArthur as commander-in-chief of UN forces. MacArthur reported to the US President and took orders from him. The war threatened to become one between the USA and China. The USA even considered using nuclear weapons against China.""

People often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg).
The mass of an object is the
or ""stuff"" it contains. The more matter an object contains, the greater its mass. An elephant contains more matter than a mouse, so it has a greater mass. Mass is measured in
A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.
All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called
. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong.
Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the
between the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be.
Weight is a force, so it's measured in
. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.
The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.
The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's
The weight of an object changes if the strength of gravity changes
Remember: a mass of 1kg has a weight of about 10N on Earth.

2111	4	"> Atmosphere and setting - Test Bite
Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

124	3	"How hard will the flu hit this season? U.S. health officials aren't sure, but they fear the number of cases may be higher than usual.
There has been a shortage of flu
this year. A flu vaccine is a substance that helps fight the flu. Most people get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Others get it in the form of nose sprays.
This year, only two companies made flu vaccine for the United States. One of the two companies found that its supply, which was being made in England, was damaged. That company was supposed to provide the United States with half of the 100 million doses of flu vaccine expected.

Flu season typically runs from November through March. Fever, a cough, a headache, and muscle aches are among the flu's many signs, or

, or type, of flu virus changes from year to year.
Due to the shortage of flu vaccine, the people at highest risk will get a flu shot first.
Because of the shortage, the people at highest risk will get the vaccine first. That group includes adults 65 and over, kids 6 to 23 months, and people with serious medical conditions. The vaccine was sent to doctors' offices that care for high-risk patients.
Despite the shortage of flu vaccine, doctors say that there are ways to stay healthy. The flu spreads through the air when infected people sneeze or cough. The virus also can spread on the hands of an infected person. Here's how to stop germs from spreading:
Wash hands regularly with soap and warm water.
Use a tissue to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. If there isn't a tissue handy, cough or sneeze into your sleeve. Using your hand may spread the germs.
Practice healthful habits, such as eating right, getting plenty of rest, and exercising.

2588	5	"Morphine is a powerful painkilling drug that acts directly on the central nervous system. It is called an opiate because it comes from the opium poppy. It is prescribed to relieve severe chronic pain, such as cancer pain, and after severe injury or surgery. Morphine has side effects such as drowsiness and blurred vision, and it is very addictive.
Heroin is manufactured from morphine and is even more dangerously addictive. But it is useful to treat severe pain in terminally ill patients, and it causes fewer unpleasant side effects than morphine. Both substances are used illegally as recreational drugs, and this is very dangerous.
Cannabis is an illegal drug that can be smoked, producing feelings of well-being. But like tobacco it can cause lung cancer and bronchitis. Unlike tobacco, it can cause permanent damage to the mental health of its users. Research has shown that cannabis has some useful painkilling properties, but it is illegal to prescribe it for this use.
All drugs have the potential to damage our health, because they change chemical processes in the body. Addictive recreational drugs may damage our health indirectly by reducing the amount of money available to buy food, and by placing users in dangerous situations. Injecting any drug with a needle and syringe that someone else has used may lead to a number of diseases from infected blood, including HIV and hepatitis. Users of illegal drugs may turn to crime to pay for their habit, and this affects the lives of other people.
A research report in 2006 classified various drugs according to their health and social risks, without reference to whether they are legal or not. In the report, heroin and cocaine are the most dangerous two drugs, alcohol is the fifth most dangerous and tobacco is ninth.

of San Francisco, California. (A pier is a platform built over water.) People like to look at boats tied up at the piers. They also enjoy watching sea lions that have made a home at one of San Francisco's piers.
San Francisco's Pier 39 is packed with sea lions. The sea lions sleep in the sun, bark loudly, and eat fish. (They don't always smell that great, however!)
Animal experts are not sure why sea lions first came to Pier 39. But the number of sea lions has grown each year since an earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989. Before the earthquake, only about 30 sea lions camped out at Pier 39. Now, the number of sea lions can be as high as 600!
Food to Eat and Room to Spread Out
Experts say the earthquake might have caused
, a type of fish, to swim closer to San Francisco than before. Herring is a favorite food of sea lions, so they might have followed those fish to shore.
Sea lions might also like the pier because they have plenty of room to spread out. The Marine Mammal Center, an organization that cares for sea animals, asked the city to protect the sea lions. Now the sea lions cannot be moved from the pier.
Sea lions can grow to be up to 8 feet long and weigh up to 850 pounds.
Sea lions can swim up to 20 miles per hour.
Sea lions usually live between 20 and 30 years.
Sea lions eat fish, squid, and octopus. They have about 36 teeth but like to swallow their food whole.
Storm drains in Oxnard, California, usually don't bark. But they do if there is a sea lion stuck inside!
Two kids called the police when they heard barking and saw a sea lion inside a

Rescue workers took the sea lion back to the Pacific Ocean in a truck. They say the sea lion was probably swimming in a local harbor when it entered the drain.

2217	5	"Fuels react with oxygen to release energy. Complete combustion happens in a plentiful supply of air. Incomplete combustion occurs when the supply of air is limited.
Complete combustion releases more energy than incomplete combustion. Incomplete combustion also creates carbon monoxide, and more soot. Several factors must be considered when choosing the best fuel for a particular purpose.
Fuels are substances that react with oxygen to release useful energy. Most of the energy is released as heat, but light energy is also released.
About 21 per cent of the air is oxygen. When a fuel burns in plenty of air, it receives enough oxygen for
Complete combustion needs a plentiful supply of air so that the elements in the fuel react fully with oxygen.
Fuels such as natural gas and petrol contain
. These are compounds of hydrogen and carbon only. When they burn completely:
the hydrogen oxidises to water - remember that water, H
hydrocarbon + oxygen    →    carbon dioxide + water
Incomplete combustion occurs when the supply of air or oxygen is poor. Water is still produced, but carbon monoxide and carbon are produced instead of carbon dioxide.
hydrocarbon + oxygen    →    carbon monoxide + carbon + water
The carbon is released as soot. Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas, which is one reason why complete combustion is preferred to incomplete combustion. Gas fires and boilers must be serviced regularly to ensure they do not produce carbon monoxide.
The Bunsen burner is commonly used in school laboratories to heat chemicals. Its fuel is natural gas, which is almost pure methane, CH
. Methane is a hydrocarbon. So the Bunsen burner has an air hole that allows complete or incomplete combustion.
When the air hole is open, air is drawn into the chimney, where it mixes with the natural gas. This ensures complete combustion:
methane + oxygen    →    carbon dioxide + water
A very hot, blue flame is produced.
The hottest part of the flame is at the tip of the dark blue cone
When the air hole is closed the natural gas can only mix with air at the mouth of the chimney. Incomplete combustion occurs as a result:
methane + oxygen    →    carbon monoxide + carbon + water
The yellow flame is often called the safety flame
A yellow flame is produced, which transfers less heat energy than the blue flame. The yellow flame is brighter than the blue flame because the specks of carbon glow when heated.
Factors influencing the use of a fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, oil and natural gas. Various factors need to be considered when deciding how to use a fossil fuel. These include:
the energy value of the fuel in J/g of fuel
the toxicity of the fuel - whether it is poisonous
any pollution caused when the fuel is used, such as acid rain
how easy it is to use the fuel
In general, solids such as coal are easier to store than liquids and gases. But they are often more difficult to light. Liquids and gases ignite more easily. They also flow, which means they can be transported through pipelines.
The table shows some approximate energy values of the different fossil fuels, and the typical mass of carbon dioxide they produce when they burn. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.
mg of carbon dioxide produced for each kJ
Coal releases the least amount of energy per gram of fuel. It also produces the most carbon dioxide for a given amount of energy released when it burns.
You are expected to be able to list factors such as the ones above. You should be able to interpret data to choose the best fuel for a particular purpose.
You should be able to write balanced symbol equations for the complete combustion, or incomplete combustion, of a simple hydrocarbon fuel, if you are given its molecular formula.
The formula of oxygen gas is O
Formulae of the possible combustion products from hydrocarbon fuels
Here are some examples of how to balance symbol equations for combustion. Remember that you should have the same number of atoms of each element on each side of the arrow.

""Kites are something people celebrate all over the world,"" event organizer Brandi Rose told
. ""The festival is a way to bring all of the
together in one place,"" she said. The culture of a group of people refers to their way of life, ideas, and traditions.
Some people have built their own kites for the festival. ""I chose to build a Japanese fighter kite,"" said Mike Van Meers. ""In 17th-century Japan, the kites were built with bamboo and paper. I'm building one with modern materials.""
Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.
Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""
The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds.

38	3	"Should Native American mascots and logos be banned from college sports?
A spectacular tradition of college football takes place before every Florida State University (FSU) home game. A student dressed as the famous Seminole leader Chief Osceola (ah-see-OH-luh) charges down the field on a horse. The student launches a flaming spear into the air, which lands midfield. The fans, a sea of red and gold, cheer wildly.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tried to end that tradition. The NCAA is the organization that oversees college sports. The NCAA banned the use of Native American names, logos, or
by sports teams after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Seminole tribes in Florida and Oklahoma objected to the ban. The NCAA then removed FSU from its list of universities that are not allowed to use such names and mascots. Although the chief will ride again, the ban remains for at least 17 schools with Native American team names and mascots. Check out both sides of the debate.
Some Native Americans are offended that some sports teams use mascots and logos from their culture. They think it promotes
A stereotype is an idea that all members of a group of people are alike in a certain way. It may be untrue or only partly true.
""It is not respectful to parade around in war paint and feathers, speak in broken English, and dance barefoot,"" John Sanchez, a member of the Yaqui/Apache tribe, told
""This is not honoring; it is making fun of.""
Those against the NCAA's new rules, including many Native Americans, say the recent ban is ridiculous. They believe that team names and mascots honor the traditions of Native Americans.
Florida Governor Jeb Bush challenged the ban. He said it insulted Seminoles who support FSU's traditions. Seminole tribe members designed the mascot's costume, say others. They add that the student who rides Chief Osceola's horse earns that honor after studying the tribe's culture.

The four Harry Potter books, by J.K. Rowling, are popular all over the world. More than 35 million copies have been sold. They have also been translated into 30 languages.
Although many kids say they love reading about Harry, some critics say the books aren't good for kids.
Many teachers say that their students don't read enough. So teachers are thrilled that many kids spend their free time reading Harry Potter books. Educators say reading helps kids do better in school. ""I know my kids aren't missing out on their reading,"" said Gillian Williams, an elementary school principal in New York City.

(BEE-dees), come in colorful boxes and in different flavors, such as chocolate, grape, and strawberry. Michael Eriksen, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said bidis ""are candy-flavored and cost less [than other cigarettes], so they appeal to some kids.""
Bidis are not candy. They actually contain even more deadly poisons than other kinds of cigarettes. The American Lung Association says bidis contain five times more
than other cigarettes. Tar is a chemical that causes disease. Nicotine is a drug that makes people crave cigarettes.
Health experts also say people who smoke bidis have to puff longer and harder than they do with other cigarettes. That means smokers breathe in more poisons.
In every state, it is illegal for kids to buy cigarettes, including bidis. The U.S. government has also banned the importing of bidis because child laborers often make them.
The laws, however, are being broken. Recently, a group of kids in Oregon went undercover to help the police. The kids, ages 8 to 15, were able to buy bidis in some stores.
Health experts say the best way to stop kids from using cigarettes is to give kids the facts about how deadly cigarettes are. Another way to keep kids from smoking ""is to get adults to quit, because they are the biggest role model for kids,"" said health expert Greg Conley.
Smoking kills parts of the lungs that allow a person to breathe. It causes illnesses, such as bronchitis and emphysema.
Smoking blocks vessels carrying blood to and from the heart. It can also lead to heart attacks.

Astronomy and space science - Years and seasons
A planet's year is the time it takes to make
around the Sun. The Earth goes once round the Sun in one Earth year. That's 365 Earth days.
We've seen already that that different planets take different lengths of time to orbit the Sun. That means their years are different lengths. Mercury has a year of just 88 Earth days, and Neptune has a year of 164 Earth years.
The Earth's axis is the imaginary line through the centre of the Earth between the South and North poles. This axis is
slightly compared to the way the Earth orbits the Sun.
We get different seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) because the Earth is tilted. This is how it works:
When the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun it is summer in the UK.
When the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun it is winter in the UK.
When it is summer in the northern hemisphere, it is winter in the southern hemisphere.
Because of the tilt of the Earth's axis the Sun moves higher in the sky in summer, when we tilt towards it, than in winter.

a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.

According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.

Wildlife officials in Florida have set up speed traps. The new speed traps, however, are not along highways. They are in the state's waterways.
The officials want to stop boaters from speeding in areas where manatees, or sea cows, live. Manatees are endangered mammals that live in water. Speedboats often collide with the slow-moving sea cows. Officials hope the new speed traps will slow down boaters.
Last year, boats injured or killed 78 manatees. During the first six months of this year, 48 manatees were injured or killed by boats.
State and wildlife officials blame the increase in manatee injuries and deaths on the number of boaters. ""There are more boats [on the water] now, so that's causing more [manatee] deaths,"" said Nancy Sadusky, an official of the Save the Manatee Club.

The Pilgrims landed near the area where the Wampanoag (wahm-pah-NOH-ahg) people already lived. The Wampanoag people knew how to stay safe during cold winters. They made homes called
(weh-TOOZ) to protect themselves from the cold. They also made warm clothing from deerskin.
The Pilgrims arrived close to wintertime. That winter was very cold, and many Pilgrims died. When spring came, a Wampanoag man named Squanto helped the Pilgrims. He showed them where to hunt, and he taught them how to grow corn. This helped the Pilgrims get food to eat.
When the fall harvest came, the Pilgrims had plenty of food to eat! They were very thankful for Squanto's help. Together, the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people had a harvest celebration. For three days, people ate, played games, and told stories to celebrate and give thanks.

2773	5	"Electricity is a convenient source of energy and can be generated in a number of different ways. You will need to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of other ways of producing energy, such as the use of nuclear power stations.
Coal, oil and natural gas are primary energy sources. Electricity is a secondary energy source because we use primary energy sources to produce it. These primary sources can be non-renewable or renewable. Electricity itself is neither non-renewable nor renewable.
it is transmitted easily over distance, through electricity cables
it can be used in many ways, for example electric lamps, heaters, motors etc
Generators can be turned directly, for example, by:
When electricity is generated using wave, wind, tidal or hydroelectric power (HEP) there are two steps:
Generators can be turned indirectly using fossil or nuclear fuels. The heat from the fuel boils water to make steam, which expands and pushes against the blades of a
. The spinning turbine then turns the generator.
These are the steps by which electricity is generated from fossil fuels:
Heat is released from fuel and boils the water to make steam.
The turbine turns a generator and electricity is produced.
The electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one form to another, or moved. Energy that is ""wasted"", like the heat energy from an electric lamp, does not disappear. Instead, it is transferred to its surroundings and spreads out so much that it becomes difficult to do anything useful with it.
Ordinary electric lamps contain a thin metal filament that glows when electricity passes through it. However, most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat rather than light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical filament lamp.
Modern energy-saving lamps work in a different way. They transfer a greater proportion of electrical energy as light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp.
Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp
From the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or ""wasted"", as heat energy.
The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation:
efficiency = (useful energy transferred ÷ energy supplied) × 100
The efficiency of the filament lamp is 10 ÷ 100 × 100 = 10%. This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy. 90% is transferred as heat energy.
The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is 75 ÷ 100 × 100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy. 25% is transferred as heat energy.
Note that the efficiency of a device will always be less than 100%.
The energy produced by burning fuel is transferred as heat and stored in water as
. The energy in steam is transferred to movement in a turbine, then to electrical energy in the turbine. Energy is lost to the environment at each stage. Here is a Sankey diagram to show these losses.
Note that only about a third of the energy stored in the fuel was transferred as electrical energy to customers.
Our renewable energy resources will never run out. Their supply is not limited. There are no fuel costs either. And they typically generate far less pollution than fossil fuels.
water energy, such as wave machines, tidal barrages and hydroelectric power
biomass energy, for example energy released from wood
Wind farms are noisy and may spoil the view of people who live near them. The amount of electricity generated depends on the strength of the wind. If there is no wind, there is no electricity.
There is a limited supply of non-renewable energy resources, which will eventually run out. They include:
fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas
Fossil fuels release carbon dioxide when they burn, which adds to the
and increases global warming. Of the three fossil fuels, coal produces the most carbon dioxide, for a given amount of energy released, while natural gas generates the least.
The fuel for nuclear power stations is relatively cheap. But the power stations themselves are expensive to build. It is also very expensive to dismantle old nuclear power stations or store radioactive waste, which is a dangerous health hazard.
The main nuclear fuels are uranium and plutonium, both of which are radioactive metals. Nuclear fuels are not burned to release energy. Instead, heat is released from changes in the
Just as with power stations burning fossil fuels, the heat energy is used to boil water. The
in the expanding steam spins turbines, which drive generators to produce electricity
Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear fuels do not produce carbon dioxide.
Like fossil fuels, nuclear fuels are non-renewable energy resources. And if there is an accident, large amounts of radioactive material could be released into the environment. In addition, nuclear waste remains radioactive and is hazardous to health for thousands of years. It must be stored safely.
They are put in drums and surrounded by concrete, and put into clay lined landfill sites.
Components from nuclear reactors, radioactive sources used in medicine or research
They are mixed with concrete, then put in a stainless steel drum in a purpose-built store.

They are stored underwater in large pools for 20 years, then placed in storage casks in purpose-built underground store where air can circulate to remove the heat produced. High level waste decays into intermediate level waste over many thousands of years.
from 2006 about the arguments for and against nuclear power.
Nuclear power stations use the heat released by nuclear reactions to boil water to make steam
The type of nuclear reaction used is called
A neutron collides with a uranium nucleus. A uranium nucleus is large and unstable.
The uranium nucleus splits into two similar-sized smaller nuclei.
These neutrons can then collide with more uranium nuclei.
These processes are repeated continuously, forming a
A nuclear chain reaction occurs when a neutron splits a nucleus, releasing more neutrons, which in turn go on to split even more nuclei.
In a nuclear reactor, the reaction is controlled so that energy is released at a steady rate.
The energy released in nuclear fission is far greater than the energy released in a chemical reaction, such as burning fuel. This means that the power output of a nuclear power station is large. The lifetime of a nuclear power station is about 20 years.
In considering the subject of nuclear power, it is important to weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages. These are some of the advantages:
no carbon dioxide is produced when the station is operating, as stated earlier
a small amount of fuel is needed, when compared with coal or gas
hazardous radioactive waste is produced, as stated earlier
building the power stations is quite expensive
decommissioning, ie taking apart, the power stations at the end of their lifetime is very costly
The nuclear fuel, usually uranium oxide, is held in metal containers called
. These are lowered into the reactor core. A coolant, usually water or carbon dioxide, is circulated through the reactor core to remove the heat. Control rods are also lowered into the core. These absorb neutrons and control the rate of the
. They are raised to speed it up, or lowered to slow it down.
Scientific applications give people things that they value, but may have undesirable impacts on the environment.
Our society uses more and more energy every year, but the carbon dioxide produced by most power stations is believed to be causing serious damage to the climate.
Natural resources should be used in a sustainable way.
The use of renewable energy sources would guarantee energy for the future. At the moment, renewable energy sources cannot provide enough energy.
There are official regulations and laws which control scientific research and applications.
The nuclear industry is regularly inspected to ensure that standards of safety are maintained.
Some applications of science have ethical implications. One point of view is that the right decision is the one which gives the best outcome for most people. Another point of view is that certain actions are never justified because they are wrong.
Disposal of nuclear waste raises ethical problems:
Some people say that we must have nuclear power, or we will not be able to combat global warming and still produce enough energy.
Others say that it is unethical to produce waste that will still be dangerous in many thousands of years’ time.
Weighing up the arguments - higher only
Before deciding on a course of action, it is important to ask if it is
. Can it be done? Then it is possible to consider if it
If nuclear waste could be sent down into the Earth’s mantle, it would take millions of years to resurface. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any way to do this. It is not feasible.
Nuclear waste could be sent into space in rockets so that it falls harmlessly into the Sun. Unfortunately, this would be far too expensive, and any accident on take-off would spread dangerous waste over a large area. It ought not to be done.
In different social and economic contexts, different decisions might be taken.
Many developing countries insist that they need to burn fossil fuels in their power stations, even if it produces global warming. They need this to allow them to catch up with the standard of living that we enjoy.

Scientists believe the horseshoe crab population around the world is falling--for many reasons. Fishermen catch horseshoe crabs and use them as bait. Pollution is hurting some of the areas in North America, from Maine to Mexico, where horseshoe crabs live. Seabirds hunt the crabs and eat the eggs that female horseshoe crabs lay.

Variation and classification - Inherited & environmental
Some variation within a species is inherited, and some variation is due to the environment.
Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the
needed for an individual. When these join at fertilisation a new cell is formed with all the genetic information needed for an individual.
Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.
