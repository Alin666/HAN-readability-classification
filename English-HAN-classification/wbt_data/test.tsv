When choosing groups for the data, make sure that each piece of data can be placed in one (and only one) of the groups.
You are investigating the length of time each member of a class spends on the internet per week. Look at the class groupings below - do you think they are right?
, because the times of '10 hours' and '20 hours' can be entered into two different groups.
For example, the time 10 hours can be entered into 0 ≤ time ≤10 (where time is less than or equal to 10 hours), and also into 10 ≤ time ≤ 20 (where time is more than or equal to 10 hours).
, because the times '10 hours' and '20 hours' cannot be entered into any of the groups.
For example, the time 10 hours can neither be entered into 0 < time < 10 (where time is less than 10 hours), nor can it be entered into 10 < time < 20 (where time is more than 10 hours).
'10 hours' is included in the second group, but not the first and '20 hours' is included in the third group, but not the second.

467	3	"During National SAFE KIDS Week, doctors plan to give kids tips about how to prevent accidents.
Each year, about 6,000 U.S. kids under age 14 are killed in accidents, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Another 120,000 kids each year are permanently disabled in accidents.
The graph shows the number of kids ages 5 to 14 who were treated in emergency rooms in 1999 for injuries suffered while doing these four activities.
""Summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids,"" said Dr. C. Everett Koop, who is head of the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Koop added, ""The good news is that families can take simple steps to ensure their kids stay out of emergency rooms.""
The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents.
In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger.
Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law.
Scooter accidents may be on the rise, but bicycles account for more injuries than scooters or any other product except cars, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign.
In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head.
The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets. But the National SAFE KIDS Campaign says only 15 percent to 25 percent of kids who ride bikes wear helmets while riding.

465	3	"What might the robot of the future be like? Will it look like a human? Will it be a giant that can haul heavy equipment? According to scientists Doug Adkins and Ed Heller, the robot of the future will be tiny.
Adkins and Heller have built a new robot that is so small, it can sit on a dime. The tiny robot weighs less than 1 ounce, has tracks like those on a tank, and carries a camera. For power, it uses three button cells (the batteries in watches).
So far, the robot cannot do many tasks. Recently, the robot steered itself through a small maze, but it moved at only 20 inches per minute. ""It can't zip along as fast as a spider or ant yet,"" said Heller.
In the near future, however, Heller plans to make faster and smaller robots. He foresees swarms of miniature robots doing all kinds of tasks. Police officers could send the small robots after crooks, and the bad guys would never know they were being tailed. Repair workers could send worker robots into tight spaces.
Perhaps in the future, swarms of minirobots will do many of the tasks, such as housecleaning, that people do today.

But some Americans acted differently. Instead of helping others, they attacked innocent Arab and Muslim Americans.
Some individuals vandalized mosques (the buildings where Muslims practice Islam, their religion). Others attacked anyone they thought looked to be from the Middle East.
Dr. Abdullah Khoui, of the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., condemned the attacks while defending his religion.
""What took place, no sound mind would approve of it, and no religion at all in the world would accept it,"" Khoui said. ""Islam does not approve of what took place.""
Arshad Majid, of the Islamic Center of Long Island, N.Y., said that Islam promotes peace.
""We're concerned that the actions of a small number of extremists is likely to paint with a very broad brush the large population of God-fearing, peace-loving Muslims in America,"" Majid said after the attacks.
President George W. Bush agreed with the Islamic leaders. While visiting a mosque, President Bush commented on the attacks on Muslim and Arab Americans. ""That's not the America I know,"" he said. ""That should not and that will not stand in America.""
Muslims practice the religion of Islam. Islam was first preached by the prophet Muhammad about 1,400 years ago.
In the 600s, Muhammad had a dream in which Allah, the Arabic name for God, called him to be a prophet. Islam means ""submission, commitment, and peace"".
Islam teaches that human diversity, or difference, is a sign of the richness of Allah's mercy. In other words, according to religious experts, Islam promotes peace.
Those experts add that the September 11 attacks do not represent Muslim beliefs. The majority of the 1.2 billion Muslims worldwide practice peace and tolerance toward others.

The Tempest second key extract - Performance
There are a lot of different ways to perform a particular scene. How is the drama created in the two Key Extracts?
From the table below, you will see there are elements of the two Key Extracts that are quite similar. But whereas there is a lot of conflict in the first extract, the second one is full of romance. This needs to be brought out in the performance.
Prospero is in control of the action. He even slows the pace down at one point to suit his own ends. He could be compared to Shakespeare, moving the plot forward and molding events.
Prospero watches from a distance and comments occasionally but does not interfere. It is as though he is part of the audience.
Is a more gentle and humorous end to what has been a very tense and action-packed scene.
A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Ariel is present at the beginning. Prospero uses magic to prevent Ferdinand from using his sword. Ferdinand seems to submit very quickly at the end of this extract, as though magic may have had some part to play.
There is no sign of magic in this extract. The setting is very ordinary as Ferdinand carries logs to Prospero's cave. Any ""magic"" that exists is in the form of the power of love.
Both Ferdinand and Miranda seem bewildered by their feelings.
Ferdinand and Miranda are bursting to reveal their true feelings to each other.
The tone changes quickly within this scene that contains violence and anger.
The tone remains calm. This is a very moving scene.
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct particular parts of the play.

586	3	"Saturn is known for its rings. But scientists now say the planet has another claim to fame. It has more moons than any other planet in our solar system.
, scientists who study space, have been studying the space near Saturn. They recently discovered a dozen moons that had never been seen before, increasing the number of known moons orbiting Saturn to 30. The newly discovered moons range in size from 4 to 19 miles across.
At one time, the tiny moons were probably large rocks traveling through space. When they passed by Saturn, the planet's gravity pulled them in and captured them. The rocks have been orbiting the planet ever since. Over time, the large moons broke apart to form the smaller moons.
""We think that most of [the tiny moons] are the shattered remnants of captured moons,"" explained astronomer Brett Gladman.
Some astronomers wonder whether Saturn will hold on to its title as the moon king. Jupiter has 28 known moons. Some astronomers think they will find more undiscovered moons orbiting Jupiter, making Jupiter the moon king.

72	3	"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.
A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

And they're off! Teams of specially trained dogs are racing to the finish line across one of the toughest terrains in the world.
Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6.
The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route.
The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami.
A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds.

, check the health of each dog.
During their journey, mushers set up camp to make sure the dogs get enough food, water, and rest. The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods.
Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.
During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told
In 1925, sled dogs in Anchorage delivered lifesaving medicine to sick children in Nome. The Iditarod teams follow the same route. The race

that the race is as much about the people, culture, and landscape of Alaska as it is about the dogs. ""I've been interested in the Iditarod since I was a kid,"" he said. ""To experience this race firsthand is like a dream come true.""
In January 1959, Alaska became the 49th state. More than twice the size of Texas, Alaska is the largest state.
Alaska's nickname is ""The Last Frontier"" because much of the land is wilderness that remains unsettled.
Mount McKinley, in Alaska, is the tallest mountain in North America.
In 1867, the United States bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million, or about 2 cents per acre.
Contrary to popular belief, Alaska is not one giant icebox! In some parts of the state, summer temperatures can reach into the 80s.

The Tempest second key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.

More people mean more use of natural resources, and bigger changes to the environment. The graph shows population growth over the last 200 years.
Humans use machines to move large amounts of earth to make new roads and buildings. We straighten rivers and build walls to stop them flooding. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, land is reclaimed from the sea. Barriers are built and water is pumped out. New dry land forms for people to use.
We also large areas of land for quarries. These are large holes in the ground where rocks containing useful metals are taken out.
The environment is also changed when land is flooded to make reservoirs for drinking water or hydroelectric power schemes. The animals and plants that live in the forest or on the land lose their habitat. They may die out in that region as a result.
Humans have been cutting down trees for thousands of years. We do this to clear land for farming and building, and for wood to use as a fuel or building material.
as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after felling, but often this is not done. The result is that the world’s forests are steadily shrinking.

The stopping distance of a car depends on two things: the thinking distance and the braking distance.
the same as mass. Mass is a measure of how much stuff is in an object. Weight is a force acting on that stuff.
You have to be careful. In physics, the term weight has a specific meaning, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms. The mass of a given object is the same everywhere, but its weight can change.
Weight is the result of gravity. The gravitational field strength of the Earth is 10 N/kg (ten newtons per kilogram). This means an object with a mass of 1kg would be attracted towards the centre of the Earth by a force of 10N. We feel forces like this as weight.
You would weigh less on the Moon because the gravitational field strength of the Moon is one-sixth of that of the Earth. But note that your mass would stay the same.
On Earth, if you drop an object it accelerates towards the centre of the planet. You can calculate the weight of an object using this equation:
weight (N) = mass (kg) × gravitational field strength (N/kg)
A person has a mass of 60kg. How much do they weigh on Earth, if the gravitational field strength is 10N/kg?
weight = mass × gravitational field strength
How much would the same person weigh on the Moon, if the gravitational field strength is 1.6N/kg?
weight = mass × gravitational field strength
You should be able to describe the forces affecting a falling object at different stages of its fall. Usually, you need to think about two forces:
The weight of the object. This is a force acting downwards, caused by the object’s mass the Earth’s gravitational field.
Air resistance. This is a frictional force acting in the opposite direction to the movement of the object.
When an object is dropped, we can identify three stages before it hits the ground:
At the start, the object accelerates downwards because of its weight. There is no air resistance. There is a resultant force acting downwards.
As it gains speed, the object’s weight stays the same, but the air resistance on it increases. There is a resultant force acting downwards.
Eventually, the object’s weight is balanced by the air resistance. There is no resultant force and the object reaches a steady speed, called the

What happens if you drop a feather and a coin together? The feather and the coin have roughly the same surface area, so when they begin to fall they have about the same air resistance.
As the feather falls, its air resistance increases until it soon balances the weight of the feather. The feather now falls at its terminal velocity. But the coin is much heavier, so it has to travel quite fast before air resistance is large enough to balance its weight. In fact, it probably hits the ground before it reaches its terminal velocity.

You should know some of the factors affecting the stopping distance of a car.
It takes a certain amount of time for a driver to react to a hazard and start applying the brakes. During this time, the car is still moving. The faster the car is travelling, the greater this thinking distance will be.
The thinking distance will also increase if the driver's reactions are slower because they are:
The braking distance is the distance the car travels from where the brakes are first applied to where the car stops. If the braking force is too great, the tyres may not grip the road sufficiently and the car may skid. The faster the car is travelling, the greater the braking distance will be.
The braking distance will also increase if:
The weather conditions are poor, such as an icy or wet road.
The car is more heavily laden, for example, with passengers and luggage.
The stopping distance is the thinking distance added to the braking distance. The graph shows some typical stopping distances.

from 2006 about the recommendation that pregnant women should be offered the flu vaccine in winter.
The government has policies on vaccination. It advises on when people should be vaccinated against different diseases. The policies and advice are updated as and when new scientific information becomes available.
Ideas about science - weighing up arguments
With respect to vaccination policies, you need to be able to:
Say clearly what the issue is. For example, is the risk of suffering side-effects from the vaccination greater or less than the risk of catching the disease?
Summarise different views that might be held. For example, some people used to think there was a risk of children developing autism when they had the MMR vaccine. Other people thought the MMR vaccine was safe and there was no risk of developing autism.
Identify and develop arguments based on the idea that the right decision is the one that leads to the best outcome for the majority of people. For example, even though there may be a slight risk from being vaccinated, society as a whole will benefit because it will help to reduce the risk of the disease being passed on to other people.
Identify and develop arguments based on the idea that certain actions are never justified, because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, most people think the government should not pass a law making vaccination compulsory, because it would take away our human right to freedom of choice.
HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. It is particularly difficult to develop a vaccine against HIV. This is because the virus not only mutates very quickly but it damages the infected person’s
the body's defence system against diseases and infections
During an epidemic, an infectious disease spreads very quickly. Epidemics can be prevented if a high proportion of the population has been vaccinated. This reduces the number of people who are able to catch the disease and pass it on to others. The more infectious the disease, the higher the proportion of the population that must be vaccinated to prevent the epidemic.
With respect to vaccination policies, you need to be able to distinguish what can be done, ie what is technically feasible, from what should be done. For example, smallpox is the only disease that has been eradicated from the planet by vaccination. This was possible because smallpox is spread by direct contact, and not through the air.
This made it possible to vaccinate enough people in the world to completely stop the disease from spreading.
Some other diseases are more infectious. But if we could vaccinate a sufficient number of the world’s population we could, in theory, eliminate the disease. However, at the moment this is not technically feasible because we do not have enough vaccine, some areas of the world are at war and inaccessible, and some people would refuse to be vaccinated.

2505	5	"Abortion is the artificial ending of the life of a foetus in the womb (uterus). A natural abortion is called a miscarriage. Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.
An abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies:
the life or physical health of the mother is at risk
the mental health of the mother is at risk
there is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled
Where the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born.
In 1974 119,000 legal abortions were carried out in England and Wales, by 2006 this figure had risen to 193,700.
The Christian Church teaches that life is a sacred gift from God:
Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
Christian teaching on abortion is complex. An early Christian document, the Didache, condemns it:
You shall not kill by abortion the fruit of the womb.
The Bible appears to say that life begins when the baby is in the mother’s womb:
For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.
opposes abortion in every instance. However, if life saving treatment given to a pregnant woman results in the unavoidable loss of a foetus, but saves the mother, then this is accepted and known as 'double effect'.
Roman Catholic teaching is that the foetus is a human being. This is clearly expressed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) which states:
From the first moment of his(her) existence, a human being must be recognised as having the rights of a person – among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life
When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
(Quakers) believe that although abortion should not be encouraged, the life of the unborn child cannot be seen as more important than that of the mother.
movement generally argues that life becomes human life at the point of conception. It says that abortion should not be allowed, but most would allow an abortion if the mother’s life was at risk or if pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.
movement generally argues that human life begins much later in pregnancy, or at birth. There are many points of view among pro-choicers, but fundamentally they think that the woman should have full control over what happens to her body.

The Red Spider Nebula formed when the star began to run out of fuel and exploded, pushing gases in its atmosphere away from the star. The remaining star collapsed to form a white dwarf star. White dwarfs are very small and very hot.
The tremendous heat from the star warms the nebula, causing it to glow red. The gases in the nebula reach temperatures of 18,000 degrees F.

Human vision is binocular, which gives us a good perception of depth. Vision defects include short-sightedness, long-sightedness and colour blindness.
The nervous system consists of the central nervous system - brain and spinal cord -and peripheral nerves. Nerve impulses travel through the axons of neurones - nerve cells. Reflex actions are fast, automatic and protective responses.
Receptors are groups of specialised cells. They can detect changes in the environment, which are called
, and turn them into electrical impulses. Receptors are often located in the
, such as the ear, eye and skin. Each organ has receptors sensitive to particular kinds of stimulus.
The central nervous system - CNS - in humans consists of the brain and spinal cord. When a receptor is stimulated, it sends a signal along the nerve cells - neurones - to the brain. The brain then co-ordinates the response.
You need to be able to name and locate the main parts of the eye.

- their eyes are on each side of their head. This gives them a greater field of view, which is useful for spotting predators. However, they have poor depth perception.
Light passes through the eyeball to the retina. It is refracted (its rays are bent) by the cornea and lens, so that the light is brought to a focus on the retina.
Someone with short-sightedness can see near objects clearly, but cannot focus properly on distant objects. This is because the lens focuses the sharpest image in front of the retina, instead of on it.
Someone with long-sightedness can see distant objects clearly, but cannot focus properly on near objects. This is because the lens focuses the sharpest image behind the retina, instead of on it.
Colour blindness is an inherited condition. The retina contains cells that are sensitive to red, green or blue light. People with colour blindness have a lack of receptors, or defects in them. People with red-green colour blindness, for example, have difficulty distinguishing shades of red and green.
The main parts of the nervous system are the central nervous system - the

The diagram shows the main parts of a motor neurone - which carries nerve impulses to effectors such as muscles.
The nerve impulse is carried in the axon.
The sheath acts as an insulator - rather like the plastic coating of an electrical wire. Neurones are adapted to their function by being long, so that they communicate with distant parts of the body. They also have branched endings called
. These connect with many other neurones.
The gap between two neurones is called a

The electrical signal travels along an axon and triggers the release of chemical transmitters from the nerve ending of the first neurone.

Someone with short-sightedness can see near objects clearly, but cannot focus properly on distant objects. This is caused by the eyeball being elongated, so that the distance between the lens and the retina is too great. It can be corrected by placing a concave lens in front of the eye.
Someone with long-sightedness can see distant objects clearly, but cannot focus properly on near objects. This is because the lens focuses the sharpest image behind the retina, instead of on it. This defect is often age-related, and due to a loss of elasticity in the lens. It is corrected by putting a convex lens in front of the eye.

""It would be great to have change in our pocket change. It is long overdue,"" said coin expert Donn Pearlman.
Coin experts suggest using images such as heroes or animals on coins. It would not be the first time coins have been changed. For example, since 1999, quarters have been updated with new images. Those images honor the history of the 50 states. Officials at the U.S. Mint say that people really like the new quarters.

Some waves must travel through a substance. The substance is known as the
, and it can be solid, liquid or gas. Sound waves and seismic waves are like this. They must travel through a medium. It is the medium that vibrates as the waves travel through.
Other waves do not need to travel through a substance. They may be able to travel through a medium, but they do not have to. Visible light, infrared rays, microwaves and other types of electromagnetic radiation are like this. They can travel through empty space. Electrical or magnetic fields vibrate as the waves travel through.

You should understand what is meant by the amplitude, wavelength and frequency of a wave.
As waves travel, they set up patterns of disturbance. The amplitude of a wave is its maximum disturbance from its undisturbed position. Take care: the amplitude is
the distance between the top and bottom of a wave. It is the distance from the middle to the top.
The wavelength of a wave is the distance between a point on one wave and the same point on the next wave. It is often easiest to measure this from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next wave, but it doesn't matter where as long as it is the same point in each wave.
The frequency of a wave is the number of waves produced by a source each second. It is also the number of waves that pass a certain point each second. The unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz). It is common for kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz) to be used when waves have very high frequencies. For example, most people cannot hear a high-pitched sound above 20kHz, radio stations broadcast radio waves with frequencies of about 100MHz, while most wireless computer networks operate at 2.4GHz.

You should know and be able to use the relationship between wave speed, frequency and wavelength.
The speed of a wave - its wave speed (metres per second, m/s)- is related to its frequency (hertz, Hz) and wavelength (metre, m), according to this equation:
For example, a wave with a frequency of 100Hz and a wavelength of 2m travels at 100 x 2 = 200m/s.
The speed of a wave does not usually depend on its frequency or its amplitude.

You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.
This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.
Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.
A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.
A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.
The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.

Carbon dioxide in the air can dissolve in rain water to form carbonic acid, H
Carbonic acid is a weak acid. It partially ionises to form hydrogen ions.
The hydrogen ions from carbonic acid give natural rain water a slightly acid pH value of 5.6. Over millions of years this very dilute acidic solution has been responsible for the formation of caves in areas of limestone rocks. Limestone is made of calcium carbonate, which reacts with acids.
calcium salt + water + carbon dioxide
During the last century the rain water in some parts of the world has become far more acidic. This acid rain has been caused by the emission of pollutant gases such as sulfur dioxide. When coal is burned in electricity power stations, sulfur impurities form sulfur dioxide.
The gas is also produced when fuels obtained from crude oil are burned. When sulfur dioxide is released into the air it reacts with water and oxygen to form sulfuric acid, H
Sulfuric acid is a strong acid. It ionises completely to hydrogen ions.
This gives rain water a pH below 5.0. Rain water that has this higher level of acidity can cause damage to buildings and statues, particularly those made of limestone. It can also reduce the growth of, or even kill, trees and crops. Acid rain may even lower pH of water in lakes, killing fish.

Look at the pie chart showing sources of sulfur dioxide pollution in the USA. What is the main source of this pollution?
Acid rain can attack statues and buildings made of limestone. Sulfuric acid in the rain water reacts with calcium carbonate in the limestone. What is the name of the salt formed in this reaction?
Acid rain is not acidic enough to harm people directly. How may acid rain indirectly cause harm to people?
Work out the relative formula mass of sulfuric acid, H
Why does rain water containing sulfuric acid have a lower pH than rain water containing carbonic acid?
The sulfuric acid in rain water could be neutralised by addition of an alkali such as calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)
Write a balanced symbol equation for this reaction.
What mass of calcium hydroxide would neutralise 10.0g of sulfuric acid?
(Relative atomic masses: Ca=40, H=1, O=16, S=32.)

by reducing the yield of crops grown for food
Carbonic acid is a weak acid but sulfuric acid is a strong acid. Carbonic acid only partially ionises to form hydrogen ions, but sulfuric acid ionises completely.
98 g sulfuric acid neutralised by 40+34 = 74g calcium hydroxide
10.0 g sulfuric acid neutralised by 10 x 74/98 = 7.55g calcium hydroxide

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

These 2-D molecular diagrams show which atoms are joined by covalent bonds, but do not show the shape of each molecule. It is possible to draw more complex 3-D diagrams to show the true shape of each molecule.
Below are some examples of 2-D and 3-D models:

Surely, your Lord is Allah. Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods; then He settled Himself on the Throne. He makes the night cover the day, pursuing it swiftly. He has created the sun and the moon and the stars, all made subservient by His command…
He it is Who sends the winds… Good land brings forth vegetation plentifully by the command of the Lord.

This process is called photosynthesis. Temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and light intensity are factors that can limit the rate of photosynthesis.
Plants also need mineral ions, including nitrate and magnesium, for healthy growth. They suffer from poor growth in conditions where mineral ions are deficient.

for storage. The stored starch can later be turned back into glucose and used in respiration. Oxygen is released as a by-product of photosynthesis.
Three factors can limit the speed of photosynthesis - light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature.
Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly, even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide. Increasing the light intensity will boost the speed of photosynthesis.
Sometimes photosynthesis is limited by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. Even if there is plenty of light, a plant cannot photosynthesise if there is insufficient carbon dioxide.
If it gets too cold, the rate of photosynthesis will decrease. Plants cannot photosynthesise if it gets too hot.
If you plot the rate of photosynthesis against the levels of these three limiting factors, you get graphs like the ones above.
In practice, any one of these factors could limit the rate of photosynthesis.
Farmers can use their knowledge of these limiting factors to increase crop growth in greenhouses. They may use artificial light so that photosynthesis can continue beyond daylight hours, or in a higher-than-normal light intensity. The use of paraffin lamps inside a greenhouse increases the rate of photosynthesis because the burning paraffin produces carbon dioxide, and heat too.
Plants need to take in a number of elements to stay alive. The most important are:
Plants get hydrogen and oxygen from water in the soil, and carbon and oxygen from carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere. Water and carbon dioxide are used to synthesise food during photosynthesis. Oxygen is used to release energy from food during respiration.
In addition to these three elements, plants need a number of minerals for healthy growth. These are absorbed through the roots as mineral ions dissolved in the soil water. Two important mineral ions needed by plants are:
- for making amino acids, which are needed to make proteins
If a plant does not get enough minerals, its growth will be poor. It will suffer from deficiency symptoms:
deficient in nitrate - it will suffer from stunted growth
deficient in magnesium - it's leaves will turn yellow
The tomato plant on the left is healthy, the one on the right is growing in conditions where mineral ions are deficient

Some household substances, such as cleaning products, are made of quite harmful chemicals - hazard labels are useful in warning of danger at home as well as in the laboratory.
Carbonates and hydrogen carbonates break down when heated in the lab, forming carbon dioxide. Similarly, cooking involves chemical reactions in which new substances are formed.
Natural substances are made in living organisms or come from the Earth. For example, they may be found in the Earth's crust, atmosphere or oceans. Artificial substances are made by chemists using chemical reactions in the laboratory or chemical factory. You need to be able to discuss any differences between natural and artificial substances.
Table salt is sodium chloride. Natural table salt is extracted from salt in salt mines or by evaporating the water from sea water. However, sodium chloride can also be made using chemical reactions. For example:
sodium hydroxide + hydrochloric acid → sodium chloride + water
The sodium chloride formed in a laboratory is chemically identical to sodium chloride found in nature (assuming other substances have been removed to make it pure). However, people often prefer natural chemicals, especially in food, clothing and cosmetics.
Food tastes and smells nice because of the chemicals it contains. Some flavours are due to simple substances, such as sodium chloride, and you cannot tell the difference between natural and artificial sources. Other flavours are due to more complex substances, such as vanilla flavouring.
Ice cream contains vanilla flavouring. Artificial vanilla is usually a substance called ethyl vanillin. This has a much stronger taste and smell than natural vanilla. It is also cheaper to make than natural vanilla, which has to be extracted from vanilla beans. People with a good sense of taste can tell the difference between the two types of vanilla, because the natural vanilla is a mixture of substances.

437	3	"Great whites are endangered. They are often hunted for their teeth and fins.
A great white shark cruised across the Indian Ocean in a record-breaking swim. The great white became the first shark known to complete a round-trip journey between two continents.
""This is the first time that an individual fish has been found to go across an entire ocean and come back to the same spot,"" says Ramón Bonfil, one of the scientists who studied the shark. Scientists named the shark Nicole, after Australian actor Nicole Kidman.
Nicole not only set a distance record but also took a bite out of the speed record. The great white clocked more than 12,400 miles on her trip from South Africa to Australia and back. She
or moved between locations, faster than any other marine animal.
The map shows Nicole’s route between South Africa and Australia.
Great whites live mainly off the coasts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Nicole’s 99-day journey was tracked with an electronic tag placed on her fin.
The tag recorded her movements, including how deep she dove in the water. The results stunned scientists. They discovered that there is more interaction among great white populations in Africa and Australia than had previously been thought.
The new find is helping scientists learn more about how sharks migrate and
(find their way). Why might Nicole have swum so far so fast? Scientists don’t know for sure, but they think one of the reasons that she may have made the trip was a search for food. Great white sharks feed mainly on whales, seals, and fish.
And how did Nicole find her way from one continent to another? Although she frequently plunged to depths of more than one-half mile, Nicole spent most of her time swimming on the surface. That led scientists to suspect that great whites might use the sun and the moon to help navigate.
The recent discoveries have excited shark lovers. ""It’s clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Bonfil. ""There is still much to learn about great white shark migrations.""
Great whites aren’t the only big fish in the sea. There are about 370 species, or types, of sharks. Here are some sharks that make a splash.
The whale shark grows up to 40 feet long and weighs about 15 tons. That’s heavier than two elephants!
The dwarf lantern shark is thought to be one of the smallest sharks. It is about 6 inches long.
Although most sharks swim about 1.5 miles per hour (mph), the mako shark is thought to cruise around at 22 mph.
The dusky shark has the most powerful bite. Its jaws clamp together with 132 pounds of force.

There are several different types of energy, and these can be transferred from one type to another. Energy transfer diagrams show the energy transfers in a process. More efficient devices transfer the energy supplied to them into a greater proportion of useful energy than less efficient devices do.
Heat is thermal energy. It can be transferred from one place to another by conduction, convection and radiation. Conduction and convection involve particles, but radiation involves electromagnetic waves.
Thermogram of a pan being heated on a stove
Heat energy can move through a substance by conduction.
, but non-metals and gases are usually poor conductors of heat. Poor conductors of heat are called insulators. Heat energy is conducted from the hot end of an object to the cold end.
The electrons in piece of metal can leave their atoms and move about in the metal as free electrons. The parts of the metal atoms left behind are now charged metal ions. The ions are packed closely together and they vibrate continually. The hotter the metal, the more kinetic energy these vibrations have. This kinetic energy is transferred from hot parts of the metal to cooler parts by the free electrons. These move through the structure of the metal, colliding with ions as they go.
Liquids and gases are fluids. The particles in these fluids can move from place to place. Convection occurs when particles with a lot of heat energy in a liquid or gas move and take the place of particles with less heat energy. Heat energy is transferred from hot places to cooler places by convection.
Liquids and gases expand when they are heated
. This is because the particles in liquids and gases move faster when they are heated than they do when they are cold. As a result, the particles take up more volume. This is because the gap between particles widens, while the particles themselves stay the same size.
The liquid or gas in hot areas is less dense than the liquid or gas in cold areas, so it rises into the cold areas. The denser cold liquid or gas falls into the warm areas. In this way,

As a country industrialises, the number of people living in urban areas tends to increase. The UK and many other MEDCs urbanised during the 18th and 19th centuries. People migrated from rural areas (due to the mechanisation in farming) to urban areas where there was employment in the new factories. The area of cities known as the inner city developed during this time as rows of terraced housing were built for workers.
Today the UK is a mostly urban society, with 90% of the population living in towns or cities.
On a global scale, urbanisation is taking place rapidly, particularly in LEDCs
Although the UK is an urban society, more and more people are choosing to live on the edge of urban areas - with many relocating to the countryside. This is called

may get worse. Many people will drive their cars into the city centre to get to work.
It is compounded by people being brought into city on large roads or motorways. These roads then link up with smaller, older, narrower roads in the city centre. This causes a bottleneck and congestion.
Some cities have tried to manage this problem by introducing traffic management schemes. These schemes may include:
Congestion charging schemes, such as those in Durham and London.
Car-pooling, as used in the USA, to encourage people to share cars.
Local councils have also tried to make the roads in urban areas safer by introducing
Traffic calming is a term used for schemes that aim to reduce the speed of road traffic. This can be done by constructing speed bumps, narrowing the road etc.

Pedestrianised areas are designated as pedestrian only zones.
Permit holder parking - certain parts of the city, particularly near the centre, are designated as permit parking only. This means that people must have a permit to park in that area. This reduces the number of people driving in to towns and cities as parking opportunities are restricted.
Vehicle exclusion zones - certain types of vehicles are excluded from certain parts of a city, eg large vehicles may not be allowed to enter narrow roads or residential areas.

Problems of urbanisation in the inner city – inequalities
. Inequality means extreme differences between poverty and wealth, as well as in people's well-being and access to things like jobs, housing, and education. Inequalities may occur in:
Often people who live in inner-city areas experience a poor quality of life. This is because the inner-city is typically a zone with older housing and declining industry. The diagram below compares the quality of life for someone living in an outer London borough with that of someone who lives in an inner London borough.

run-down inner-city areas. Inner-city redevelopments, such as those in London's Docklands or Manchester's Salford Quays, may improve the physical environment of the area and improve the quality of housing. However, it can also create even greater inequalities because the local residents may not be able to afford to live there anymore. Often the old industrial jobs are replaced by skilled jobs and new people move to the area.
Problems of urbanisation in the urban rural fringe – housing demand
[an error occurred while processing this directive]
changes are leading to a greater demand for housing. People are living longer, and choosing to marry later, and in recent years there has been a rise in the number of single-parent families. Added to this, the UK is experiencing immigration from other countries, eg from Poland which has recently joined the EU. The result is an ever-larger number of smaller households, all requiring accommodation.
However, building new, affordable homes in urban areas is difficult. Land values are very high and land is in short supply:

Hitler's actions helped him to consolidate his power - it is more about the effects of what he did. The table below describes how certain events that happened between 1933 and 1934 gave Hitler the opportunity to consolidate power.
Hitler used the fire to his advantage in two ways:
It gave him an opportunity to imprison many communist leaders, which stopped them campaigning during the election.
It allowed the Nazis to say that the country was in danger from the communists during its election campaign.
Both these actions helped the Nazis to
When the courts convicted Dutch Communist van der Lubbe, but did not convict other Communist leaders, Hitler was furious and replaced the courts with the Nazi People's Courts.
Although it did not give the Nazis the majority that Hitler had hoped for in the Reichstag, it gave them enough seats - after Hitler had arrested all the communist deputies and the other parties had been intimidated by the SA - to get the Enabling Act passed, which is all Hitler needed to do.
Arguably the critical event - it gave Hitler

within the Nazi Party. It gave power to the brutal SS. It also showed the rest of the world what a tyrant Hitler was.
Many historians believe that Nazi Germany only appeared to be a dictatorship. In fact, officials were left to make most of the decisions themselves, and the Nazi government was badly-organised, and chaotic.
It is important to note that in 1934, the army was not subject to Hitler's authority. At this point, he still needed the army's support, which is why he destroyed the SA in the Night of the Long Knives.
In 1938, army leaders hoped Hitler's plan to conquer the Sudetenland would fail and give them an opportunity to

The answer will provide few reasons for the emergence of NICRA with no real explanations offered.
The answer will provide more reasons with some explanations offered.
The answer will provide a number of reasons with detailed explanations.
NICRA was set up because of events in the USA where Martin Luther King Jr. was leading a similar campaign in America in the 1960s. At the same time discrimination in Northern Ireland was still continuing. NICRA campaigned for ""One Man, One Vote"".
John would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate only touches on the influence of the USA and events in Northern Ireland. The candidate does not develop the two points to answer the question fully and directly.
NICRA emerged due to a number of events and influences. A major factor in its emergence was the impact of the 1947 Education Act. This made Catholics more confident in the 1960s to demand civil rights. A further influence was the establishment of the Campaign for Social Justice in 1964. This organisation highlighted the forms of discrimination that existed in Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s. This helped bring about the establishment of NICRA in 1967.
A final factor to explain the emergence of NICRA was Labour's victory in the 1964 General Election.
Paul would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate makes two valid points in the first paragraph. However other important factors are omitted and he does not explain the last point in the second paragraph.
The emergence of NICRA can be explained by a number of events, both within Northern Ireland and outside of Northern Ireland. The 1947 Education Act helped to create a larger professional and educated Catholic class in Northern Ireland. It was more assertive and confident in demanding civil rights for all by the mid 1960s.
Also within Northern Ireland there was the Campaign for Social Justice that was set up in 1964. This organisation acted as a forerunner for the emergence of NICRA in 1967.
Furthermore within Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s, members of a number of political parties, as well as labour and republican groups were working to establish a civil rights movement. They felt that O'Neill's government had done little to address grievances in voting, housing, policing and employment.
Outside of Northern Ireland there were other influences. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of a civil rights movement in the USA. It was having some success and this inspired a similar movement in Northern Ireland.
Also in 1964 a Labour government was elected in Britain. Labour was seen as being more sympathetic to the nationalist cause. This may have raised the expectations of Catholics into believing that a protest group campaigning for civil rights might succeed. A year later over 100 MPs in Britain formed the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster. This further raised the expectations of Catholics and influenced the establishment of NICRA.
Michael would get a level 3 for this answer. This response is very direct and extremely comprehensive. The candidate is aware of all the important factors that account for the emergence of NICRA.

Cree started volunteering when she was in fourth grade because she loves animals. Dogs in the program learn how to open and shut doors, turn lights on and off, throw away trash, and pick up items for people who are in wheelchairs. Each dog learns a total of 90 commands.
""The hardest command to teach a dog is the stand-stay position,"" Cree told
. In that position, the dog stands at its owner's side when it is not doing anything else.
Cree says that training dogs has taught her patience and responsibility. ""It's really fun,"" she told
. ""The animals get really attached to you, and it's hard to say good-bye.""
Although saying good-bye isn't easy, Cree knows that she has helped both the dog and its grateful owner. When she grows up, Cree plans to be an animal doctor called a

As the wheels on the bus go round and round, many kids are being bounced around. A new study shows that about 17,000 accidents occur on school buses each year. Injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers report that crashes aren't causing all of those injuries. Kids are sometimes thrown around when buses stop and turn. Some people say those injuries could be prevented if school buses had seat belts.
Traffic safety experts say seat belts would not

We will look at how the resistance in the filament of a lamp changes when the filament heats up. You will also learn about diodes, heat-dependent resistors (called thermistors) and light-dependent resistors (LDRs).
An electric current flows when charged particles called electrons move through a conductor. The moving electrons can collide with the
All elements are made of atoms. An atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons.
An electrical conductor is a material which allows an electrical current to pass through it easily. It has a low resistance. A thermal conductor allows thermal energy to be transferred through it easily.
. This is called resistance and it makes it harder for current to flow. These collisions make the conductor hot. It is this that makes a lamp filament hot enough to glow.
. The greater the number of ohms, the greater the resistance.
The equation below shows the relationship between resistance, voltage, current:
) = volts (V) / amperes (A)
The current flowing through a resistor at a constant temperature is directly proportional to the voltage across the resistor. So, if you double the voltage, the current also doubles. This is called Ohm’s Law. The graph shows what happens to the current and voltage when a resistor follows Ohm’s Law.
Bicycles with battery operated lights often have different size bulbs for the front and rear lights. The filament in the front lamp has a resistance of 3 ohms. It takes a current of 0.6A. What voltage does it work at?
The answer is 1.8V. If you didn't get the correct answer make sure you have used the formula correctly.
So the voltage in the lamp is 3 x 0.6 = 1.8 volts
You should know how to change the

in a circuit and how to work out the resistance in a series circuit.
You will not need to worry about the resistance of the wires joining the circuit together. In most circuits, the resistance of the connecting wires is so small that it can be ignored.
When components are connected in series, their total resistance is the sum of their individual resistances. For example, if a 2
resistor are connected side by side, their total resistance is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6
If you increase the number of lamps in a series circuit, the total resistance will increase and less current will flow. Check your understanding of this using this simulation. Click on the switch to close the circuits.

The opposition in an electrical component to the flow of electricity through it. Resistance is measured in ohms.
Thermistors are used as temperature sensors, for example, in fire alarms. Their resistance decreases as the temperature increases:
At low temperatures, the resistance of a thermistor is high and little current can flow through them.
At high temperatures, the resistance of a thermistor is low and more current can flow through them.
LDRs (light-dependent resistors) are used to detect light levels, for example, in automatic security lights. Their resistance decreases as the light intensity increases:
In the dark and at low light levels, the resistance of an LDR is high and little current can flow through it.
In bright light, the resistance of an LDR is low and more current can flow through it.

for resources. Before the beginning of agriculture about 10,000 years ago, small groups of humans wandered across large areas, hunting and gathering just enough food to stay alive. Population numbers were kept low because of the difficulty of finding food.
The development of agriculture led to a population explosion that has accelerated enormously during the past 500 years. Unlike other species, humans can
Human population growth over the past 10,000 years
People in the developed world enjoy a high standard of living, with abundant food, cars and comfortable housing. People in the developing world have a lower standard of living, but many countries are catching up quickly.
The world’s human population has passed 6 billion and continues to increase. The growth in the human population and the increase in the standard of living are putting strains on the global environment. Here are some of the ways in which this is happening:
non-renewable energy resources, such as coal, oil and natural gas, are being used up rapidly
raw materials are being used up rapidly
A mountain of household and industrial rubbish
Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.
Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even common household items can contain
such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.
is also discharged onto the land. Many farmers apply
chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage crops
to improve their crops, but these can damage living things. Toxic chemicals can be washed from the land into rivers, lakes and seas.
Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and land
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas.

animals cannot survive in polluted water, so their presence or absence indicates the extent to which a body of water is polluted.
The most common source of air pollution is the combustion of
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.
. This usually happens in vehicle engines and power stations.
Deposits soot on buildings and trees, causing them damage. Permeates the air, making it difficult for living creatures to breathe.
greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming
depletes ozone in the upper atmosphere, so damages the ozone layer
Lichens are plants that grow in exposed places such as rocks or tree bark. They need to be very good at absorbing water and nutrients to grow there, and rainwater contains just enough nutrients to keep them alive. Air pollutants dissolved in rainwater, especially sulfur dioxide, can damage lichens, and prevent them from growing. This makes lichens natural indicators of air pollution. For example:
leafy lichens can survive a small amount of air pollution
crusty lichens can survive in more polluted air
In places where no lichens are growing, it's often a sign that the air is heavily polluted with sulfur dioxide.
Individuals that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce than those that are well adapted. Similarly, it is possible that a species that is poorly adapted to its environment will not survive and will become extinct.
Here are some of the factors that can cause a species to become extinct:
changes to the environment, such as a change in climate
since life on Earth began. Extinction is still happening and a lot of it occurs because of human activities. We compete with other living things for space, food and water, and we are very successful predators.
The dodo was a large flightless bird that lived on Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean. The island was uninhabited and the dodo had no natural predators. Then Mauritius was colonised by the Dutch in 1638. Dodos were

The panda and gorilla are endangered, and may become extinct. Some species in Britain are endangered, too, including the red kite, red squirrel and osprey. They could be helped by measures such as:
legal protection and protection of their habitats
making artificial ecosystems for them to live in
These measures are difficult to implement when dealing with certain organisms, such as whales. These animals live in international waters, so international laws and agreements are needed to protect them.
Fish are an important part of the human diet, accounting for a worldwide average 15% of humans' protein intake. Most of these fish are caught wild, and if fish are caught at a faster rate than the remaining fish can reproduce, the stock of fish will obviously decline. Trying to harvest more fish than the sea can produce is an example of
an activity which uses up resources or damages the environment so that it cannot be continued in the future
Since the 1960s North Sea cod have been overfished, as more and more - and bigger - fishing boats caught more and more cod. At first, catches continued to increase each year. But then - surprise, surprise! - they started to decline, as there were not enough breeding fish left to maintain the cod population. Today, North Sea cod are in danger of extinction.
Humans have now been cutting down trees for around 10,000 years - for wood to burn or build with, or to clear land for farming.

. This type of forest is often referred to as 'the Earth's lungs' because it produces around 40% of the world's atmospheric oxygen. It is also home to an estimated 50% of all species on Earth - once lost, the original habitats can never be replaced. Tropical rainforest is being cut down at the rate of 17 - 20 million hectares a year.
Humans reduce the amount of land and resources available for plants and animals. This happens because of farming, quarrying, dumping waste and building.
Urbanisation means the growth of cities. About
half the world’s population live in cities
, and most of the population growth in the future is expected to take place in cities. It is predicted that by 2015,
the world’s six largest cities will each have more than 20 million inhabitants
. These are some of the effects of urbanisation:
land no longer used for food production
decline of rural towns and villages as people leave them to live in cities

It is important to all of us, not just the other inhabitants of the planet, that sustainable development is achieved. This involves each of us as individuals, and careful planning at local, regional and global levels.

the spinning turbine turns a generator which produces electricity
the electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage
when they burn, we are aiming to produce more of our electricity using other,
energy resources. This will reduce the rate at which the fossil fuels are used up.
We can also reduce the rate at which the fossil fuels are used up by saving energy. For example, we can:
walk to instead of getting using cars where possible
turn off the lights when leaving the room

Some schools are giving students two sets of textbooks. Students keep one set in school, and they leave the other set at home. That way, kids don't have to carry books back and forth every day.
Experts say that a kid who weighs 60 pounds should carry a backpack that weighs 9 pounds or less. If a kid weighs 70 pounds, his or her pack should weigh no more than 12 pounds.

""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure,"" says Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which produces all U.S. paper money.
The $10 bill is the latest in the series to get a new design. The $50 bill was updated last year, and the $20 bill was given a makeover in 2003.
There are several colorful changes on the new bill. A red image of the Statue of Liberty's torch appears next to the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the treasury. On the portrait's other side is the phrase ""We the People,"" also in bright red ink. The background is light orange, and small yellow 10s surround the torch. A new ink makes the numeral 10 in one of the corners change color from copper to green when the bill is tilted.
But don't expect to find the new $10 note in your wallet just yet. In January 2006, the U.S. government will begin to circulate the new bills. The government plans to redesign the currency every seven to 10 years to stay ahead of counterfeiters.

Most log cabins were small because it took pioneers so long to build them. Many log cabins had only one room. Most pioneers burned a fire to keep their log cabins warm.
Most pioneers made their own clothing. It was usually made of leather, cotton, or wool. Pioneers dried animal skins to make leather. They used the leather to make shoes and belts. Pioneers spun wool or cotton into yarn and wove it into cloth. Here, a woman makes wool yarn with a special tool called a
At first, pioneer children learned math, reading, and writing at home. Pioneer parents taught their children.
As more people came to town, workers built a schoolhouse. Then the pioneers hired a teacher for the children.
Stew was a popular pioneer food. Read the recipe for making stew, and then answer the questions. Kids: If you make the stew, be sure to have an adult help you with each step.
At first, pioneers had to get their own food. They picked berries and nuts. Pioneers also hunted and fished. They planted crops such as corn and squash. When towns formed, the pioneers built small stores called general stores. People could buy supplies such as flour, coffee, and salt there.

Without the right body conditions, certain processes (eg osmosis) and proteins (eg enzymes) will not function properly.
Living cells depend on the movement of chemicals around the body. Chemicals such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and dissolved food need to be transported into and out of cells. This is done by the processes of diffusion and osmosis, and these processes depend on the body's water and salt balance, which are maintained by homeostasis.
Cells depend on enzymes to speed up the many chemical reactions that keep the cell alive and make it do its job. These enzymes work best at particular temperatures, and so again homeostasis is vital to cells as it maintains a constant body temperature.
Particles in liquids and gases move about randomly in all directions.

During osmosis, more water molecules pass from the pure water into the dilute solution than pass back the other way. This is because there is a higher concentration of water molecules in the pure water than in the solution. This results in more water molecules diffusing across the concentration gradient from the water to the solution. Eventually, the level on the more concentrated side of the membrane will rise, while that on the less concentrated side falls.

Rather than finding a smooth surface, scientists discovered a crater near one end of Asbolus 8405. And centaurs are not made entirely of ice, either. Scientists saw material inside the crater that did not look like frozen water. Some scientists now say centaurs are made of a mixture of water, methane, and ammonia ice.

The fraction of the energy supplied to a device which is transferred in a useful form.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one form to another or moved. Energy that is 'wasted', like the heat energy from an electric lamp, does not disappear. Instead, it is transferred into the surroundings and spreads out so much that it becomes very difficult to do anything useful with it.
Ordinary electric lamps contain a thin metal filament that glows when electricity passes through it. However, most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat energy instead of light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical filament lamp.
Modern energy-saving lamps work in a different way. They transfer a greater proportion of electrical energy as light energy. This is the Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp.
Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp
From the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or 'wasted', as heat energy.
The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation:
efficiency = ( useful energy transferred ÷ energy supplied ) × 100
The efficiency of the filament lamp is (10 ÷ 100) × 100 = 10%.
This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (90% is transferred as heat energy).
The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is (75 ÷ 100) × 100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (25% is transferred as heat energy).
Note that the efficiency of a device will always be less than 100%.

In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion.
A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on.
a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?
b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?
The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.
a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:
b) 20cm on the boat = 1cm on the model

If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000 × 100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.
The map scale is 1:50 000, so we divide by 50 000

Power stations are built in order to generate electricity. The illustration shows the main steps involved.
Water is turned into steam in the boilers
The turbines spin the generators, which produce the electricity
The electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage
The energy needed to boil the water comes from fossil fuels or nuclear fuels. Renewable energy resources such as wind and wave power may drive the generators directly.
A transformer is an electrical device that changes the voltage of an alternating current (AC) supply, such as the mains electrical supply. A transformer changes a high-voltage supply into a low-voltage one, or vice versa.

a transformer that decreases the voltage is called
Electricity is transferred from power stations to consumers through the wires and cables of the National Grid. When a current flows through a wire some energy is lost as heat. The higher the current, the more heat is lost. To reduce these losses,
the National Grid transmits electricity at a low current
Power stations produce electricity at 25,000V. Electricity is sent through the National Grid cables at 400,000V, 275,000V and 132,000V.
Step-up transformers are used at power stations to produce the very high voltages needed to transmit electricity through the National Grid power lines. These high voltages are too dangerous to use in the home, so step-down transformers are used locally to reduce the voltage to safe levels. The voltage of household electricity is about 230V.
A correctly wired three-pin mains electricity plug is important for using electricity safely.

Fuses in plugs are made in standard ratings. The most common are 3A, 5A and 13A. The fuse should be rated at a slightly higher current than the device needs:

Electrical appliances are earthed or double insulated for safety.
Many electrical appliances, including cookers, washing machines and refrigerators, have metal cases. The earth wire creates a safe route for the current to flow through, if the live wire touches the casing.
You will get an electric shock if the live wire inside an appliance, such as a cooker, comes loose and touches the metal casing. However, the earth terminal is connected to the metal casing, so the current goes through the earth wire instead of causing an electric shock. A strong current surges through the earth wire because it has a very low resistance. This breaks the fuse and disconnects the appliance.
Some appliances, such as vacuum cleaners and electric drills, do not have an earth wire. This is because they have plastic casings, or they have been designed so that the live wire can not touch the casing. As a result, the casing cannot give an electric shock, even if the wires inside become loose. These appliances have double insulation and carry a symbol.

As well as solving simultaneous equations algebraically, you can solve them by rearranging them into the form of y = mx+c so that you can plot as straight line graphs. When you have plotted the graphs, you can work out the values of x and y that solve the equations.
To refresh your knowledge of straight line graphs, look at
Use the graphical method to solve the simultaneous equations:
Start by rearranging the two equations to get them in the form:
In this case you only need to rearrange the second equation. The two equations are now:
We now have two equations of straight-line graphs, which we can plot.
When we do this we can look at where the two lines cross (the point of
). The values of x and y at this point are the solutions of the simultaneous equations.
The solution of this pair of simultaneous equations is
x = 2 and y = 4

2480	5	"Digital radio signals maintain their quality better than analogue signals. They are less prone to interference. All signals become weaker as they travel long distances, and they may also pick up random extra signals. This is called noise, and it is heard as crackles and hiss on radio programmes.
Noise adds extra random information to analogue signals. Each time the signal is amplified, the noise is also amplified. Gradually, the signal becomes less and less like the original signal. Eventually, it may be impossible to make out the music in a radio broadcast against the background noise, for example.
Noise also adds extra random information to digital signals. However, this noise is usually lower in amplitude than the amplitude of the ON states. As a result, the electronics in the amplifiers can ignore the noise, and it does not get passed along.

The world's entire population of lowland gorillas live in the Congo Basin. Those creatures are among many species of endangered animals living in the rain forest.
The gorilla is one of the endangered animals living in the Congo Basin.
Scientists warn that more than half of the forest could disappear within 50 years. Some people illegally cut down trees and hunt wildlife to sell as meat. Many rain forest animals, like the lowland gorilla, are endangered because of illegal hunting.
Gorillas are plant eaters. They also like to eat insects, such as termites and ants. An adult male eats about 40 pounds of food each day!
Young gorillas love to play. They learn new skills by imitating adult gorillas.
Each gorilla has a unique nose print. Scientists can identify a gorilla by the shape of its nose.
Help is on the way for the rain forest and the animals that live there. The presidents of 10 African countries recently signed a

Keeping homes warm, and how insulation works
Heat energy can be transferred by conduction, convection, and radiation. The loss of heat from poorly insulated homes wastes energy resources and costs money. There are several ways to insulate homes against heat loss. It is possible to evaluate different ways to save energy by calculating their payback times.
Heat is thermal energy. It can be transferred from one place to another by conduction, convection and radiation. Conduction and convection involve particles, but radiation involves electromagnetic waves.
Thermogram of a pan being heated on a stove
Heat energy can move through a substance by conduction. Metals are
of heat, but non-metals and gases are usually poor conductors of heat. Poor conductors of heat are called insulators. Heat energy is conducted from the hot end of an object to the cold end.
Metals consist of metal ions and free electrons. Ions are charged particles formed when the metal atoms lose their electrons - and these become free electrons. The ions are packed closely together and they vibrate continually. The hotter the metal, the more kinetic energy these vibrations have. This kinetic energy is transferred from hot parts of the metal to cooler parts by the free electrons. These move through the structure of the metal, colliding with ions as they go.
Liquids and gases are fluids. The particles in these fluids can move from place to place. Convection occurs when particles with a lot of heat energy in a liquid or gas move and take the place of particles with less heat energy. Heat energy is transferred from hot places to cooler places by convection.
when they are heated. This is because the particles in liquids and gases move faster when they are heated than they do when they are cold. As a result, the particles take up more volume. This is because the gap between particles widens, while the particles themselves stay the same size.
The liquid or gas in hot areas is less dense than the liquid or gas in cold areas, so it rises into the cold areas. The denser cold liquid or gas falls into the warm areas. In this way,
that transfer heat from place to place are set up.

All objects give out and take in thermal radiation - also called infrared radiation. The hotter an object is, the more infrared radiation it emits. This infrared radiation can be reflected by shiny surfaces. Infrared radiation is absorbed best by black, dull - not shiny - surfaces.
Infrared radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation. It involves waves, rather than particles. Unlike conduction and convection, radiation can even work through the vacuum of space. This is why we can still feel the heat of the Sun even though it travels through a vacuum for 150 million km to reach the Earth.

2173	4	"The extract comes from a book called 'Face' by Benjamin Zephaniah. Natalie is a Year 9 student and lives in East London. She is out with her boyfriend and his friends. They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you.
After a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous.
Natalie shifted nervously. She didn't know quite where to look but she had to put on a front. The other three girls made no attempt to hide the fact that they were on Natalie's case. They began to whisper to each other and smile as they stared at her. Natalie felt illuminated in her green satins and began to wish she had chosen clothes which weren't so loud. What are they grinning at? she wondered. Is it my clothes? My shoes? My hair? Do I look too innocent? Suddenly the three girls began to walk toward Natalie. Her heart began to race, the palms of her hands began to sweat. She felt like falling apart but she held herself together.
'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag.
'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?'
The other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars.
'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.'
At this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?'
Natalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender.
'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces?
How does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract?
her first reactions to the girls she sees
the way she acts just before, and when, they speak to her
her thoughts at the end of the passage.
Just before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight.
When she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.

The hammerhead suffered the steepest drop-an 89 percent decrease. The number of great white sharks declined by 79 percent.

Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.
7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.

2778	5	"Conditions in the body are controlled, to provide a constant internal environment. This is called homeostasis. The conditions that must be controlled include body temperature, water content, carbon dioxide level, and blood sugar level.
Hormones are chemicals secreted by glands. They travel through the bloodstream and affect target organs. Sexual development, the menstrual cycle and fertility in women, and blood sugar levels, are all controlled by hormones.

Human enzymes usually work best at 37ºC, which is human body temperature. This can be measured in several places, including the ear, finger, mouth and anus.
There are various ways to measure body temperature, including using a clinical thermometer, heat-sensitive strips, digital probes or thermal imaging cameras.
high temperatures can cause dehydration, heat stroke, and death if untreated
low temperatures can cause hypothermia, and death if untreated
The body’s temperature is monitored by the brain. If you are too hot or too cold, the brain sends nerve impulses to the skin, which has three ways to either increase or decrease heat loss from the body’s surface:
Hairs on the skin trap more warm air if they are standing up, and less if they are lying flat. Tiny muscles in the skin can quickly pull the hairs upright to reduce heat loss, or lay them down flat to increase heat loss.
If the body is too hot, glands under the skin secrete sweat onto the surface of the skin, to increase heat loss by evaporation. Sweat secretion stops when body temperature returns to normal.
Blood vessels supplying blood to the skin can swell or dilate - called vasodilation. This causes more heat to be carried by the blood to the skin, where it can be lost to the air. Blood vessels can shrink down again - called vasoconstriction. This reduces heat loss through the skin once the body’s temperature has returned to normal.
Muscles can also receive messages from the brain when you are cold. They respond by shivering, which warms you up.
- Hair muscles pull hais on end.
- Hair muscles relax. Hairs lie flat so heat can escape.
- Sweat secreted by sweat glands. Cools skin by evaporation.
A very common mistake in exams is to write that the blood vessels move up and down in the skin. The blood vessels do not move during vasodilation and vasoconstriction.
Hormones are chemicals secreted by glands in the body. Different hormones affect different target organs.
The bloodstream transports hormones from the glands to the target organs. Bodily reactions to hormones are usually slower and longer lasting than nervous reactions.

Diabetes is a disorder in which the blood glucose levels remain too high. It can be treated by carefully maintaining a certain diet or injecting insulin.

Both hormones are secreted by the ovaries. The image below shows how the levels of oestrogen and progesterone change during the menstrual cycle. If a woman becomes pregnant, the level of progesterone remains high.
Human fertility is controlled by hormones. This means that a knowledge of hormones can be used to decide to increase, or reduce, the chances of fertilisation and pregnancy.
'The pill' is an oral contraceptive that greatly reduces the chances of mature eggs being produced. The pill contains oestrogen, or oestrogen and progesterone. These hormones prevent eggs from maturing in the ovaries.
Some women have difficulty becoming pregnant because they do not produce enough of a hormone called FSH, which is needed for eggs to mature. Fertility drugs contain FSH, which stimulates eggs to mature in the ovary.

K2 is the second highest mountain in the world at 8611m. Mountain climbers say it is even harder to climb than Mount Everest, which was climbed one year before the first successful attempt on K2.
. Hypothermia and frostbite occur as the nose, fingers and toes begin to freeze. Winds can reach over 90 miles per hour and the dry air and physical exertion means that climbers can soon become dehydrated and need to drink up to six litres of water each day.
Also the amount of oxygen available to breathe drops with increasing altitude. At sea level the amount of oxygen in the air is about 21% with a pressure of 760 mmHg. As altitude increases the percentage remains the same but the pressure drops. At 3000m the pressure is 540 mmHg, at 5000m it is 420 mmHg and at the top of K2 can be as low as 253 mmHg. This means there are fewer oxygen molecules per breath so the breathing rate increases to try to get more oxygen into the blood.
Another problem experienced by many climbers is
. Low air pressure can cause fluid to leak from the capillaries in both the lungs and the brain. This results in a build-up of fluid. As the pressure drops and the fluid build up increases, the life-threatening condition of altitude sickness occurs.
Name the process by which the body keeps a constant internal environment.
What happens to the air pressure as climbers go up Mount Everest?
What percentage of the air is oxygen at the top of K2?
Describe two effects that high altitude can have on the human body.
A climber stays close to the top of K2 for two days. How much fluid are they likely to drink?
Explain what happens to the body temperature when hypothermia occurs at high altitude.
Explain why breathing rate increases as climbers get to higher altitudes.
To the nearest whole number, calculate the percentage of oxygen molecules available in each breath to a climber on top of K2 when compared to a person at sea level.
Describe the effect of cold temperatures on the skin and body of climbers.
Suggest what should be done for a climber that experiences altitude sickness.
Thoroughly check your answers as marks will be awarded for correct spelling, punctuation and grammar.
The process by which the body keeps a constant internal environment is called homeostasis.
Air pressure gets less as altitude increases.
21% - it is the same as at sea level.
You can have marks for any two from this list of the effects of high altitude :
12 litres (2 days x 6 litres = 12 litres)
Intense cold causes the core body temperature to drop from 37ºC to below 35ºC.
Less oxygen is available so breathing rate increases to get the oxygen into the blood.
33%. You need to work out air pressure at the top of K2 (253mmHg) as a percentage of pressure at sea level (760mmHg).
(253 ÷ 760) × 100 = 33.289....
Sweating decreases, shivering occurs, blood vessels constrict, blood flow to skin is reduced which reduces energy loss.
Supply the climber with oxygen and get the climber down to a safer altitude.

As smoke billowed from the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, a dark cloud seemed to descend over the world.
As news of the terrorist attacks spread, people were shocked and horrified by the terrible events.
Throughout the world, people expressed outrage at the attack. ""It's just sick,"" said one firefighter. An airplane expert said, ""This is perhaps the [worst] terrorist attack that's ever happened in the world.""
Like adults, kids were very upset by the attacks. Many of them first learned about the brutal attacks at school.
In many schools, students and teachers comforted one another. Teacher Diane Bulens said the principal at her school in California told the teachers to watch out for the students and then ""told the kids to take care of the teachers.""
Donna Taylor, a teacher in Ohio, said some of the students in her school had friends and family in New York and Washington, D.C.
One student was worried about her father, who was in New York. Taylor offered to let the student use her cell phone to learn whether her father was OK. He was!
Taylor told her students that terrorists wanted ""to disrupt everyone's lives, but we aren't going to allow them to disrupt our day.""
Even though teachers and students looked after one another, many were still fearful that something more would happen. Erin Ricketts, age 11, feared that her state would be attacked. ""I heard California may be next,"" she said. She added that she was worried ""because my mom works in a big building.""
After school, many students went home to talk with their parents about the attacks. Doctors say that in this tragic time, kids, parents, and teachers need to talk to one another. By coming together, Americans will grow and become stronger than ever.

Each year, however, 15 million kids worldwide die from diseases, including hepatitis, cholera, and diarrhea, Arntzen said. Most of the children who get those diseases live in the poorest countries in the world, mainly in Asia, Africa, and South America.
Arntzen says it's impossible to send a doctor to vaccinate kids in every village in the world. Even if doctors could go to every village, many poor people couldn't afford to pay for the vaccinations.
That's why scientists are working on ways to change fruit and vegetable seeds. They want to make vaccines part of the plants, explained Arntzen. If the scientists are successful, people in poor countries could use the seeds to grow food that would protect them from some diseases. That way, an apple a day would not only keep the doctor away, but would keep deadly diseases away as well.

Griswold, who is a radio traffic reporter by day, runs a ""bat hospital"" in her Connecticut home. While you won’t find these little creatures stretched out on hospital beds, you might find one or two of them snuggling up to Griswold.
At her home, Griswold cares for bats that are sick, injured, or orphaned. She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers.
She has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a
, or animal doctor, Griswold helps nurse the winged mammals back to health. Then she sets them free.
But Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm.
To her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats.
This bat lady, however, doesn’t keep Poppy all to herself. Poppy is one of the winged creatures that Griswold brings with her on school visits. In fact, this Halloween she is speaking at a Connecticut school. Griswold, who teaches kids about bats, is on a mission to change their reputation.
. Many people, she says, are afraid of bats, but they’re actually gentle, shy creatures that are important to the environment.
Bats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. ""There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do,"" said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia.
However, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees.
But Griswold’s message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. ""The kids are making such a huge difference,"" she said.
There are almost a thousand species of bats worldwide. Bats come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Some have huge ears and unusual faces. In fact, a bat’s face can teach you about its habits. Read on about some of these creatures.
Vampire bats can be found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. They drink blood, but it’s usually from cattle and horses--not people. A heat sensor on its nose helps it find blood close to the surface of its victim’s skin.
Egyptian fruit bats live mainly in Asia and Africa. They eat fruit and nectar. Their long noses help them locate ripe fruit. Fruit bats use their sharp teeth to chew fruit.
This bat’s ears are almost as long as its head and body. It uses its ears to detect insects. This bat, which is found in parts of North America, feeds mainly on moths.

Do the coins bearing President Lincoln’s face still make sense? People on both sides of the debate have put in their two cents’worth.
Nearly 60 percent of Americans stash their pennies rather than spend them. For many, the penny is annoying. The coins are hard to spend. Vending machines and parking meters, for example, don’t accept them. Cashiers often are frustrated when people pay with them.
""The penny has been a nuisance for years, and now it costs more than one cent to make the penny,"" Kolbe told
His plan calls for rounding ""all final sales, up or down, to the nearest nickel.""
Kolbe and others point out that pennies are expensive to produce. Pennies account for more than half of the U.S. Mint’s coin production. It will cost about $44 million dollars to produce pennies this year. That is nearly $14 million more than it cost in 2005.
Mark Weller of the group Americans for Common Cents believes that efforts to remove the penny will fail because Americans want to keep the coin. ""Two-thirds of the public think it’s important to have the penny in circulation,"" he told
Weller and others fear that rounding up prices to the nearest five cents will hurt consumers. ""Consumers lose without the penny,"" adds Weller.
He also says that many charities depend on these coins. Last year, children in New York City donated more than 65 million pennies, adding up to more than $650,000.

2624	5	"You will usually have to prepare a short talk on one topic and answer questions on your talk.
What you must be able to do
the amount of interesting information you give
the range of language you use; for example, your ability to give descriptions, ideas and opinions; also your ability to speak about the past and future
your ability to speak fluently and with good pronunciation
Ask your teacher to show you the standard of work required at different levels. For example, he/she should be able to take a topic, such as 'my part time job' and demonstrate the differences between performance at grades E, C and A.
It is usually a good idea to choose a topic based on your own personal experience; for example, a holiday, a hobby, a hero of yours, a person you know or a part-time job. Topics like these provide plenty of scope for interesting details, opinions and descriptions, as well as references to the past and future.
The first part of your preparation will involve writing some notes and learning them.
Your presentation is not likely to last much more than a minute (check this with your teacher), so what you prepare at this stage should be based on quality rather than quantity. This means that you should aim at getting across some basic information (for example, where I went on holiday, who I went with, what I did, my opinion of the town/country).
The language you use at this stage must be your language at your level.
Do not prepare notes with words or phrases that are too difficult or complicated. If you do, you will not produce a confident, fluent presentation and you will get a low mark.
When you have prepared your notes, ask your teacher to check the Spanish.
Now learn your script by heart, so you can end up saying it with no more than five words, phrases or illustrations as memory prompts. An excellent way to do this is to record your presentation on tape and keep playing it back.
The next step is to make your presentation sound fluent, confident and as Spanish as possible. The better you know it, the easier it will be to make it seem natural and spontaneous.
Take a good look at what you have achieved so far. If a part of your presentation is causing you problems, get rid of it or simplify it.
Look for opportunities to improve your work by adding a few more interesting details. Remember - it is easy to improve a simple piece of work. It is much harder to simplify something that is too complicated!
The presentation is usually followed by a discussion in which the examiner will ask you some questions. Make a list of what these questions might be, and prepare some more material that will help you provide good answers.
Now practise your presentation several times, with only your prompts to refer to. Practise in front of a friend. Time the presentation. Get a friend to ask you some of the additional questions you have prepared. You are now ready!
If you have prepared well, you will not be struggling to remember difficult or unfamiliar material, so the monologue should go according to plan.
Don't panic if the examiner asks you a question you have not prepared. Short answers, as well as complete sentences are both acceptable. It is important that you respond quickly and confidently. Small errors will not lose many marks.
Where possible, try to use the examiner's questions as 'triggers' to help you say as much good Spanish as you can. For example:
If your topic is a holiday and the examiner asks you about the weather, you could develop your reply by talking about what you did (because the weather was fine) and then adding that one day it rained, so you went shopping and bought presents for your friends.
If you are asked if you would like to go there again, you could answer yes or no and then give two or three simple reasons, such as '

Native Americans used resources that were easy to find in their regions. Resources are useful things that come from nature, such as berries for food or trees for building homes.
Many Native Americans made their clothing from the skin or fur of animals. Deerskin was one of the most popular clothing materials in North America. Inuit people, from the Arctic, wore warm coats made of sealskin or caribou fur.
Each group of Native Americans had its own special beliefs. Many groups made carvings to show their beliefs. Native Americans from the Northwest made wooden carvings, called

Blood sugar level meter and insulin shot pen
Diabetes is a disorder in which the blood glucose levels remain too high. It can be treated by injecting insulin. The extra insulin allows the glucose to be taken up by the liver and other tissues, so cells get the glucose they need and blood-sugar levels stay normal.
Natural insulin can be taken from the pancreases of pigs or cattle, but this insulin does not suit some people and is limited in supply.
Nowadays most insulin is synthesised using genetically modified (GM) bacteria. The gene for insulin secretion is cut from a length of human DNA, and inserted into the DNA of a bacterium. The bacterium is then cultivated and soon there are millions of bacteria producing human insulin.

. This means that knowledge of hormones can be used to decide to increase, or reduce, the chances of fertilisation and pregnancy.
The oral contraceptive ('the pill'), greatly reduces the chances of a woman producing mature eggs, and therefore her chances of becoming pregnant. The pill contains oestrogen, or oestrogen and progesterone. These hormones inhibit the production of
Follicle Stimulating Hormone, which stimulates oestrogen production and the growth of follicles (egg-sacs) in the ovary. It is secreted by the pituitary gland.
, which in turn stops eggs maturing in the ovaries.
Although the pill is useful in helping avoid unwanted pregnancy, some women who take it may suffer from changes in weight, mood and blood pressure, as a result of the hormones in it. There is also a chance of an increased risk of developing blood clots. On the other hand, there is evidence of a decreased risk of developing cancer of the uterus or ovaries.
Some women have difficulty becoming pregnant because they don't produce enough FSH to allow their eggs to mature. 'Fertility drugs' contain FSH, which stimulates eggs to mature in the ovary.
Fertility treatments increase a woman's chance of becoming pregnant, although the treatment may not always work. On the other hand, because the treatment boosts the production of mature eggs, multiple conceptions sometimes occur, with twins or triplets being expected. This increases the risk of complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and may lead to premature or underweight babies.
If a couple are having difficulty conceiving a child, because the quantity or quality of the man's sperm is poor, in vitro fertilisation - or IVF - can be used. This is where the egg is fertilised outside the woman's body and then implanted back into her uterus. As FSH can also be used to encourage the production of several mature eggs at once, it is used as part of IVF to increase the number of eggs available for fertilisation.
Some people worry about the ethical implications of IVF, and are concerned that couples may only want fertilised eggs with 'desirable' qualities. For example, they may want a girl if they have lots of boys in the family, or they may wish to avoid producing a baby with an inherited defect.
The menstrual cycle in women is a recurring process, taking around 28 days. During the process, the lining of the uterus - womb - is prepared for pregnancy, and if pregnancy does not happen, the lining is then shed at menstruation.

Alleles can be recessive - showing up only when there are two of them - or dominant - showing up always. Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder caused when an individual inherits two faulty alleles of a certain gene.
A transgenic organism is one that is created by genetic modification (GM), also called genetic engineering. GM organisms can produce useful substances for us.
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a process that helps women who have difficulty in getting pregnant normally. It involves fertilising a woman's egg outside her body, then implanting it back. Some people are worried that IVF will lead to 'designer babies'.

Genetic variation gives rise to differences between individuals that are inherited. For example, our eye colour is inherited from our parents. But our phenotype is also affected by environmental variation such as:
Many kinds of variation are influenced by both environmental and genetic factors, because although our genes decide what characteristics we inherit, our environment affects how these inherited characteristics develop. For example:
a person might inherit a tendency to be tall, but a poor diet during childhood will cause poor growth
plants may have the potential for strong growth, but if they do not receive sufficient mineral resources from the soil, they may hardly grow at all
Identical twins are a good example of the interaction between inheritance and environment, as such twins are genetically the same. Any differences you may see between them – for example in personality, tastes and particular aptitudes – are due to differences in their experience or environment.
You will recall that genes have different forms called alleles. An allele can be recessive or dominant.
allele only shows if the individual has two copies of the recessive allele. For example, the allele for blue eyes is recessive. You need two copies of the allele to have blue eyes.
allele always shows, even if the individual only has one copy of the allele. For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant. You only need one copy of the allele to have brown eyes (and two copies will still give you brown eyes).
Individuals A and B have brown eyes - only individual C has blue eyes
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a recessive allele. You need to inherit two copies of the faulty allele to have CF. If you just have one copy of the faulty allele, you are a carrier but have no symptoms. If two carriers have a child between them, there is a
chance of that child having the disorder. The inheritance diagram shows why this happens.

Many cats and dogs have turned into couch potatoes in need of more exercise and less food. Scientists report it's not just people gaining weight. Their pets are putting on the pounds too!
According to the National Research Council, one out of every four cats and dogs in the United States weighs too much. How did these animals get so plump? Many of their owners overfeed them.
Like people, overweight cats and dogs have a greater risk of developing heart disease and other health conditions. The clue for determining whether a pet is overweight is in the ribs. ""If you can feel the ribs under your pet's skin but not see them, your pet is a perfect weight,"" animal expert Karen Volkerts told
Owners can help their plump pups and fat cats shed some extra pounds. Animal experts recommend feeding pudgy pets smaller portions, reducing their number of feedings, and using diet pet food. Regular exercise will also help pets trim down and stay healthy.
Many owners reward their pets or show them affection by giving them table scraps and other treats. Volkerts says that dogs and cats have their own food for a reason.

Bezoar is a stone that grows in the stomach of a goat found in the Middle East. It was thought to be an antidote to poison (the word is Persian, and means 'counterpoison').
The French surgeon-doctor Paré tested this in a crude and cruel scientific experiment. He gave poison to a condemned criminal, followed by bezoar, and then observed what happened:
Some years ago, a gentleman boasted before King Charles that bezoar was an antidote for all poisons ... It was an easy matter to make trial of this claim on those condemned to be hanged [and a criminal] had poison administered to him ...
An hour after, I found him on the ground on his hands and feet like an animal, with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes wild, vomiting, with blood pouring from his ears, nose and mouth. Eventually he died in great torment, seven hours after I gave him the poison. I opened his body and found the bottom of the stomach black and dry, as if it had been burned, whereby I realised that he had been given sublimate of mercury, whose force the bezoar could not stop.

Work done and energy transferred are measured in
. The work done on an object can be calculated if the force and distance moved are known.
Objects raised against the force of gravity contain gravitational potential energy.
The more mass an object has and the faster it moves, the more kinetic energy it has.
You should know and be able to use the relationship between work done, force applied and distance moved.
Work and energy are measured in the same unit, the
change in energy (joule, J) = work done (joule, J)
This equation shows the relationship between work done, force applied and distance moved:
work done (joules, J) = force (newtons, N) x distance (metres, m)
The distance involved is the distance moved in the direction of the applied force.
A force of 10N is applied to a box to move it 2m along the floor. What is the work done on the box?
The work done is 10 × 2 = 20J.
The work is done on the bottom of the box and on the floor. The energy increase is shown by both of these getting hotter.

For example, if a 1N weight is raised by 5m it gains 1 × 5 = 5J of gravitational potential energy.
What is the change in gravitational potential energy (GPE) when a 1kg mass is raised from 1m above ground to 3m above ground?
First work out the weight of the object:
Weight = mass × gravitational field strength
Weight = 1 × 10 = 10N
Next work out the change in height:
Change in height = end height – start height
Change in height = 3 – 1 = 2m
Finally, work out the change in gravitational potential energy:
Change in GPE = weight × change in height
Change in GPE = 10 × 2 = 20J
Every moving object has kinetic energy (
). The more mass an object has and the faster it is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. So the bigger the object, the faster it will move.
This equation shows the relationship between kinetic energy (J), mass (kg) and speed (m/s):
kinetic energy = 1/2 × mass × speed
What is the kinetic energy of a 1000kg car travelling at 10m/s?
kinetic energy = 1/2 × mass × speed
kinetic energy = 1/2 × 1000 × 10
= 1/2 × 1000 × 100 = 50,000J (or 50kJ)

– the total amount of energy present stays the same before and after any changes.
The pendulum shows the principal of conservation of energy in action. Gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and back, over and over again, as the pendulum swings.
The diagram shows a pendulum in three positions - the two the ends of it's swing and as it passes through the middle point.
When the pendulum bob is at the start of its swing it has no kinetic energy because it is not moving, but its
The energy stored by an object lifted up against the force of gravity.
is at a maximum, because it is at the highest point.
As the bob swings downwards it loses height. So its gravitational potential energy (GPE) decreases. The work done on the bob by the gravitational force (weight) pulling it downwards increases its kinetic energy. The loss of GPE = the gain in KE.
At the bottom of its swing, the bob’s kinetic energy is at a maximum and its gravitational potential energy is at a minimum - because it is at its lowest point.
As the bob swings upwards it slows down. Its kinetic energy decreases as work is done against its weight. As it gains height the gravitational potential energy increases again.
At the very top of its swing it stops for a moment. It once again has no kinetic energy, but its gravitational potential energy is at a maximum.
At all points during the swing, the total (GPE + KE) is constant.
Note that in a real pendulum the bob’s swing will become slightly lower with each swing, because some energy is lost (dissipated, ‘wasted’) through heating, due to air resistance.
You should be able to calculate the kinetic energy gained when an object falls from a given height.
A diver who has a mass of 50 kg dives off a diving board 3.0 metres above the water level. What is her kinetic energy when she reaches the water?
Kinetic energy gained = gravitational potential energy lost
Kinetic energy gained = weight × height
You must calculate her weight to use in this equation
Weight = mass × gravitational field strength
Weight = 50 kg × 10 N / kg
Kinetic energy gained = weight × height
Kinetic energy gained = 500 N × 3 m
You should be able to extend the previous calculation to work out the speed of the object.
How fast is the diver moving when she reaches the water?
Put her kinetic energy (the 1500J you have calculated) into the kinetic energy equation together with her mass
kinetic energy = 1/2 × mass × speed
1500 J = ½ × 50 × speed
= 1500/25 = 60 (This is not the answer yet! It is speed
So her speed = square root of 60 = 7.7 m/s

2745	5	"Source analysis - death of Charles II based on Scarburgh's description
The 'cures' tried by Charles II's doctors after he had had a mild stroke - which he might have recovered from quickly today - certainly hastened his death. The following is a modern description of the treatment of Charles II, summarised from a description written by his chief physician, Sir Charles Scarburgh:
When Charles II of England lay dying from a convulsion which attacked him while shaving, the medicos of that day left no stone unturned in helping him along to the Great Beyond. First, he was bled of a pint of blood. Then his shoulder was cut and eight ounces more of blood was extracted by cupping.
Then followed an emetic, a purgative and another purgative. Next, an enema in which they used antimony, sacred bitters, rock salt, mallow leaves, violet, beet root, camomile flowers, fennel seed, linseed, cinnamon, cardamom seed, saffron, cochineal and aloes. This enema was repeated. In two hours, another purgative was given.
The King's scalp was then shaved, and a blister raised on it. They gave him next sneezing powder of hellebore root; they sought to strengthen his brain by giving him powder of cowslip flowers. Purgatives were frequently repeated. He was given drinks of barley water, licorice, sweet almonds, white wine, absinthe, anise seed, extracts of thistles, rue, mint and angelica. When these did not cure him, they gave him a poultice of burgundy pitch and pigeon dung, to be applied to his feet. More bleeding, more purging; they added melon seeds, manna, slippery elm, black cherry water, extracts of flower of lime, lily of the valley, peony, lavender and dissolved pearls. When these did not do the trick, they went at it with gentian root, nutmeg, quinine and cloves. When this failed, he was given forty drops of extract of human skull. Then they forced down his throat a rallying dose of herbs and animal extracts. Then some powdered bezoar stone.
Alas, after an ill fated night His Serene Majesty was so exhausted that all the physicians became despondent. And so, more active cordials, and finally pearl julep [a heart tonic] and ammonia, were forced down the royal patient's throat. Then he died.

There a number of ways you can look at the conflict on the Plains.
It is possible to see the conflict as a

Consequently, they distrusted and feared them, and could believe anything (including torture and deceit) of a people they did not understand. Conversely, the Native Americans felt that white Americans were devils who ruined the earth. Differences of culture caused them to hate and despise each other, and led to war.
The wars might be seen as the

, Native Americans had nothing to lose - as the Sioux Chief Gall said:
""You fought me and I had to fight back""
It could be argued that war broke out simply because the white men wanted the Great Plains - firstly to cross, then for gold, then for cattle and then for farming. Many white Americans believed that it was their

White Americans demanded a settled, farming way of life. They thought that tipis were:
""...too full of smoke ... inconceivably filthy""
Horace Greeley despised the Native Americans for:
""...sitting around the doors of their lodges at the height of the planting season""
""...squalid and conceited, proud and worthless, lazy and lousy. These people must die out,... God has given this earth to those who will subdue and cultivate it.""
White Americans believed that God had given them the right to

White Americans thought only they could make full use of the land.
They gave the Plains to the Native Americans when they thought they were

White Americans could not understand why chiefs could not make their warriors obey them.
Government based on 'community spirit' was incomprehensible to white Americans, whose government was based on laws and compulsion.

White observers declared that the Native Americans were 'without government'.
Exposure of old people to the elements, to die

2616	5	"You should be able to calculate the masses of reactants and products from balanced equations, and the formula of a compound from information about reacting masses.
You will not be asked to calculate any concentrations of solutions in GCSE Additional Science, but you need to know certain things about concentration.
The concentration of a solution is measured in
. The greater the concentration, the more dissolved particles there are in the solution:
Equal volumes of different solutions that have the same concentration contain the same number of particles of dissolved solute. For example, a solution at 2 mol/dm
is twice as concentrated as a solution at 1 mol/dm
You will not be asked to calculate any volumes of gases in GCSE Additional Science, but you need to know certain things about them.
Equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules. For example:
of hydrogen contains twice as many molecules as 25cm
of oxygen at the same temperature and pressure.
One mole of any gas at room temperature and normal pressure occupies about 24 dm
You can use information about reacting masses to calculate the formula of a
A compound is a substance formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
Suppose 3.2g of sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce 6.4g of sulfur oxide. What is the formula of the oxide?
of sulfur is 32 and the A
Find the mass of each element. Conservation of mass tells us that the mass of oxygen = the mass of sulfur oxide - the mass of sulfur.
The mass of oxygen reacted = 6.4 - 3.2 = 3.2g
So we have 3.2g of sulfur and 3.2g of oxygen.
Now divide the mass of each element by its A
Finally, find the ratio of the elements.
You can do this by dividing the results by the smallest of the numbers to give you the number of atoms of each element in the compound.
In this case the smallest value is 0.1, so divide both results by that.
S = 0.1 ÷ 0.1 = 1
O = 0.2 ÷ 0.1 = 2
(If one of the numbers ends in 0.5, multiply all the numbers by 2 - this is because you cannot have half-atoms in a compound.)
So the ratio of sulfur to oxygen is 1:2
The number of atoms tells you that the formula for sulfur oxide is SO
Here is the calculation again in tabular form to help you remember the steps:
Steps to calculation the formula of a compound
Result: the formula for the oxide = SO
If you have a balanced equation for a reaction, you can calculate the masses of
substances present at the start of a chemical reaction
A product is a substance formed in a chemical reaction.
(s)    →    CaO(s) + CO
, how much CaO can we make?
is 40 + 12 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 100
of CaO is 40 + 16 = 56
would yield 56g of CaO in this reaction. In the question we are told we have only half of that amount of CaCO
, 50g. So we will get half the amount of CaO, 28g.
mass of CaO we can make = 28g
Notice in this that 22g of CO
would also be produced, as 50 - 28 = 22
In practice, it is not always possible to get the calculated amount of product in a reaction:
reversible reactions may not go to completion
some product may be lost when it is removed from the reaction mixture
some of the reactants may react in an unexpected way
of a reaction is the actual mass of product obtained. The
For example, the maximum theoretical mass of product in a certain reaction is 20g, but only 15g is actually obtained.
The maximum theoretical mass of product itself can be calculated using a reacting mass calculation, such as the one on the previous page.
The atom economy of a chemical reaction is a measure of the amount of starting materials that become useful products. Inefficient, wasteful processes have low atom economies. Efficient processes have high atom economies, and are important for sustainable development, as they use fewer natural resources and create less waste.
The atom economy of a reaction can be calculated:
total mass of products equals the total mass of reactants
, you can put that into the bottom of the fraction in the calculation like this:
For example, what is the atom economy for making hydrogen by reacting coal with steam?
12       2 × 18                44           2 × 2
total mass of products = 44 + 4 = 48g (note that this is the same as the reactants: 12 + 36 = 48g)
This process has a low atom economy and is therefore an inefficient way to make hydrogen. It also uses a non-renewable resource: coal.

2389	5	"Beer and wine are alcoholic drinks made by fermentation reactions that use yeast to convert sugars into ethanol. There are harmful effects and social problems because of ethanol in drinks.
Intelligent packaging keeps food fresh by removing water from the food, or stopping it reacting with oxygen.
Emulsifiers have a 'water-loving' head and a 'water-hating' tail. These substances allow oil and water to mix so they can become emulsions such as mayonnaise.
Ethanol is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks such as wine and beer.
Sugar from plant material is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide by fermentation. The enzymes found in single-celled fungi - yeast - are the natural catalysts that can make this process happen. Here are the word and balanced formulae equations:
sugar    →    ethanol + carbon dioxide
Fermentation usually works best at around 37ºC. It is a slow process and several weeks or more are usually needed to produce an acceptable alcoholic drink.
The sugars for beer-making come from boiling barley in water. Hops are added to adjust the flavour of the beer.
The sugars for wine-making come from grape juice. Different varieties of grapes are used to produce wines with different flavours. Wine contains a higher proportion of ethanol than beer does, because grape juice contains a higher concentration of sugars than barley in water.
Ethanol is a depressant - it slows down signals in the nerves and brain. Small amounts of alcohol help people to relax, but greater amounts lead to a lack of self-control and loss of judgement. Drinkers may put themselves in dangerous situations, and may not realise how much they are drinking. They may fall ill, or become unconscious.
Ethanol is also toxic. Yeast are actually killed by the ethanol they produce. Long-term effects of drinking excessive amounts of alcoholic drinks include damage to the liver and brain. It may also cause weight gain, and is addictive.
People suffering from 'hangovers' after drinking alcoholic drinks may be unable to function normally the next day. This puts strain on their family and their colleagues, and can lead to family problems, lost work and missed business.
Ethanol causes damage to the liver, and leads to a risk of stroke or heart disease. This causes problems both for the drinker, and for those around them. Such diseases require the resources of the Health Service, which means it has less to spend on treating other illnesses.
accidents caused by people who drive or use machinery while drunk
vandalism, fighting and other forms of anti-social behaviour
bacteria and fungi that grow on or in the food
chemical reactions that take place in the food, such as fats reacting with oxygen to make rancid products
Food is also spoiled if it gets damaged or crushed.
Bacteria and fungi are living organisms. They need water and oxygen - as well as the food itself - to grow and reproduce. If one or both of these is taken away, the microbes are unable to survive and the food will last longer.
Water can be removed by drying the food. Modern ‘freeze-drying' methods allow many food items to be dried so that they last longer. Freeze drying is popular for instant drinks, packet soups and fruit pieces in breakfast cereals
Oxygen can be restricted just by packaging the food in plastic, or sealing it in an air-tight container. However, the food itself contains some oxygen, and microbes can still survive in it. The air in modern packaging is often replaced by gases such as nitrogen. This restricts the amount of oxygen available, so microbes cannot grow and reproduce. There are other benefits to this method, too:
fats in the food cannot react with oxygen to produce substances with rancid smells and flavours
substances in sliced fruit and vegetables cannot oxidise and turn the food brown
crisps and other easily damaged foods are protected from being crushed
Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - water-loving - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils
a hydrophobic end - water-hating - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.
Mayonnaise and emulsion paints are emulsions, but there are others - such as the two in the table.

2763	5	"People sometimes say that discrimination is created when prejudice is combined with power. Prejudice is the attitude of someone whose opinion is not based on fact. Prejudice can be triggered by differences of religion, race, colour, sex, language, disability or age. Prejudice is not illegal, as an attitude can’t be illegal, but discrimination is illegal.
All forms of discrimination go against the first two Articles of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights:
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
Christianity teaches that everyone is equal in the eyes of God. Therefore there is no reason to treat people differently.
Christian teaching about other people is based on
I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.
You shall love your neighbour as yourself.
There are also two important teachings in the writings of Paul about this:
From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
No one can follow these teachings perfectly, and there will be occasions when Christians, like those of other faiths, are guilty of prejudice and discrimination.
But there are many examples too of Christians challenging injustice when they see the laws of God being broken.
John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, is from Uganda where he was a lawyer and judge until 1975 when he was forced to flee to Britain when President Idi Amin started a reign of terror against his own people. Archbishop Sentamu has done a lot to raise awareness of racism in British society and in the Anglican church.
Many people think that the Christian Church is sexist. It does not treat men and women equally.
The teaching of St Paul is often quoted to support the way some churches today treat women. From the extracts below, it would seem that he believed that the role of women was different to that of men, and secondary to it.
Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they want to enquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
Now I want you to realise that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonours his head. And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonours her head - it is just as though her head were shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.
The Right Reverend Kay Goldsworthy - Australia's First Female Bishop
Jesus, however, always showed by his actions that he respected and valued women. He included them among his closest companions, and sometimes went against the conventions of his time which kept men and women apart. Jesus made it clear in the Parable of the Good Samaritan how his followers should treat people – he made no distinction between men and women.
Some Christian denominations have recently begun to allow women to be priests or ministers (eg, Church of England and the Methodist church). Some remain opposed to this (eg, the Roman Catholic Church). Some Christians believe that women are second to men, that men should lead and women should follow (see 1 Timothy 2:8–15).
So although Christianity teaches that everyone should be equal and should be treated the same, this doesn't always happen.

However, some people ignore the laws and still hunt elephants. The huge animals are also endangered because people build homes and farms in areas where elephants live.
African elephants are the largest living land animals. The average male weighs more than four cars!
An African elephant never sweats. Heat escapes through its large ears to keep the animal cool.
African elephants like to take baths every day. Then, they cover themselves in dirt to keep insects away.
The work scientists are doing at Animal Kingdom may help African elephants in the wild. ""If we can tell individual voices apart, we can keep track of each elephant over time,"" says Savage.

What would be the cost of a party for 20?
50 + 20 × 5 = 50 + 100 =
How do you work out the cost if you don't know the number of people who will attend the party?
The cost for 10 people is 50 + 5 × 10 = £100
The cost for 20 people is 50 + 5 × 20 = £150
So the cost for n people is 50 + 5 × n = £(50 + 5n)
With this formula you can work out the cost of a party for any number of people.
Have a go at the next question to see if you can use
Alexa is 12 years old. How old will she be in n years time?
years time her age will have increased by n. So her age will be n more than it is now.
Check your answer. In 1 years time she will be 13. If we put 1 in for the value of
we get 12 +1 = 13. So that is correct.
In ten years she will be 22, and putting n=10 gives us
age = 12 + 10 = 22
Time to formulate a new revision plan!

574	3	"Meet a robot that has been busy tooting its own horn. A trumpet-playing robot made its debut at a hotel in Japan in March.
The robot played the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" After its performance, the 4-foot-tall droid bowed its head and waved its arms in response to the audience's applause.
Although the musical droid doesn't have a name yet, it is the latest in a string of
that scientists have built in the past few years. Humanoid robots are high-tech machines that act lifelike and are programmed to do jobs that people typically do.
Japanese companies lead the way in creating humanoid robots. Japan is thought to be the leader in
Other humanoid robots created by Japanese companies have been getting plenty of attention even without playing the trumpet.
Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it.
Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune.
In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.
1. QRIO shows off some dancing skills. QRIO stands for ""quest for curiosity."" Why do you think the robot was given that name?
2. ASIMO (which is short for Advanced Step in Innovative MObility) walks down a flight of stairs.
3. In March, this latest humanoid robot-still unnamed-plays the trumpet at its first public appearance in Japan.
Robots are used for a variety of purposes from helping out in offices to performing surgery.
2. Sico the robot helps children paint pictures at an Arkansas hospital.
3. There is a two wheeled robot that can guide blind people.

122	3	"South America's frog populations are on the decline. That spells trouble for the environment.
Ecuador is home to hundreds of types of frogs and toads. But now scientists are worrying about their health.
The mountains and thick forests of Ecuador, in South America, are home to 417 types of frogs and toads. Tiny red-eyed tree frogs hide inside flowers. Bumpy-skinned toads use their sticky tongues to catch mosquitoes and other prey. Colorful poison dart frogs rest on tree branches. These brightly colored frogs are packed with poison, which protects them from their enemies.
, or types, of frogs and toads in Ecuador are at risk of dying out. According to a recent report by the group NatureServe, eight frogs have become
, or died out, in North and South America in the last 100 years. ""It's the same magnitude event as the extinction of the dinosaurs,"" says scientist Luis Coloma.
. Amphibians are animals with backbones that spend part of their life in water and part on land. Frogs and toads lay jellylike eggs in water. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which breathe through gills. As the tadpoles grow into frogs or toads, they develop lungs and live on land.
Like reptiles, such as lizards and snakes, amphibians are
. That means their body temperature depends on the environment. Unlike reptiles, amphibians lack protective scales. Amphibians must live near water so that their skin stays moist.
Over the last 50 years, many amphibian species have become extinct. Two of every five of the 3,046 species that live in North and South America are at risk of vanishing.
Why are these creatures in trouble? Their
is being destroyed as loggers cut down trees to make room for farms and roads. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal makes its home. Disease, weather changes, and pollution are other causes of the decline in amphibian populations.
Scientists are concerned about the decrease in the number of frogs. The health of frogs is closely linked to the health of the environment. ""Amphibian extinction is an indicator of [a problem with the environment],"" scientist Jonathan Campbell told
Because amphibians breathe through their skin, they easily absorb pollution. They are usually the first to disappear when the environment is under threat. As a result, some frogs are born with
, or wrongly shaped, body parts, such as extra legs and eyes. When frogs with strange body parts are found in an area, it is a clue that the environment is polluted or suffering.
Scientists are fighting to save amphibians. Some scientists believe that South America's poison dart frogs have chemicals in their body that can be used to treat diseases, such as cancer. The scientists want governments to pass laws that will reduce pollution and to create parks that protect the amphibians' habitat.
""Almost half of the extinctions are happening for unknown reasons,"" scientist Robert Kaplan told
. ""Scientists have a lot of work to do, and quickly.""
Here are some of Ecuador's threatened frogs and toads.
live in top layers of trees and come down to the ground only once a year, on a moonless night, to lay eggs.
live in trees and have translucent, or almost see-through, skin. The creature's red heart is visible from the outside.
have colorful, smooth skin, often with spots or streaks of orange, red, yellow, blue, or green.
Why is it important for scientists to know whether an area is polluted?

Next is the trunk layer, which provides shelter or food to insects, caterpillars and larvae.
Finally comes the branches, leaves and canopy. In this zone bees gather pollen and nectar, fungi grow on the leaves, gall wasps and moths lay their eggs, and squirrels gather acorns. Small birds such as bluetits hunt the moth larvae; and sparrowhawks hunt the small birds.
An oak tree ecosystem. Each zone of the tree is home to a distinctive community of organisms
Each of the organisms in this ecosystem has a particular way of fitting into the oak tree environment - they each occupy a
particular place or role occupied by an organism within an ecological community
within the ecosystem. For example the blue tits and the squirrels, though they both inhabit the same tree, do not directly compete for food: the squirrels feed on acorns, while the tits feed on moth larvae. The two species occupy different niches within the oak ecosystem.
Living things can be classified according to their characteristics. Many can be

Sometimes a species may have different kinds or breeds that show great variation, but the individuals still belong to the same species. Different breeds of pedigree dog are like this.
From left to right - Beagle, Wheaten Terrier, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Red Siberian Husky, Irish Setter, Golden Retriever, Boxer, Sheltie
Similar species tend to live in similar habitats, and are closely related in evolutionary terms. They are likely to share a relatively recent ancestor. Closely related species living in different types of habitat may have different characteristics. You can use
to identify organisms according to their features.
In the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus started the modern system of putting species of organism into certain groups and giving them scientific names. Each species is given a name using Latin words, so that the same name can be used all over the world. For example, the scientific name for human beings is Homo sapiens. The first part of the name tells you the genus, while the second part of the name tells you the particular species in that genus.
Dolphins and whales are mammals that live in the sea. They have very similar features to fish such as sharks. This is because adaptations such as fins and a streamlined shape were important if the animals were to survive in this environment.

387	3	"North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site, viewed from space in February 2002
In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.
Area: 46,500 square miles (about the size of Mississippi)
Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)
Economy: it has the fourth largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.
U.S. official have said they will communicate with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program. President Bush has said that the world will respect North Korea when it is no loner a nuclear threat.
North Korea and South Korea are located on a Peninsula in Eastern Asia. Soldiers from the United States and South Korea routinely divides North Korea and South Korea. After World War II (1939-1945), Korea was split in half. In 1950, the Korean War began when North Korea attacked South Korea, The United States helped defend South Korea.

2453	5	"Household substances are all chemicals, including food. You may find some of these chemicals in the laboratory as well. Many are obtained from natural sources and others are made artificially, using chemical reactions.
Some household substances, such as cleaning products, are made of quite harmful chemicals - hazard labels are useful in warning of danger at home as well as in the laboratory.
Carbonates and hydrogen carbonates break down when heated in the lab, forming carbon dioxide. Similarly, cooking involves chemical reactions in which new substances are formed.
Natural substances are made in living organisms or come from the Earth. For example, they may be found in the Earth's crust, atmosphere or oceans. Artificial substances are made by chemists using chemical reactions in the laboratory or chemical factory. You need to be able to discuss any differences between natural and artificial substances.
Table salt is sodium chloride. Natural table salt is extracted from salt in salt mines or by evaporating the water from sea water. However, sodium chloride can also be made using chemical reactions. For example:
sodium hydroxide + hydrochloric acid → sodium chloride + water
The sodium chloride formed in a laboratory is chemically identical to sodium chloride found in nature (assuming other substances have been removed to make it pure). However, people often prefer natural chemicals, especially in food, clothing and cosmetics.
Food tastes and smells nice because of the chemicals it contains. Some flavours are due to simple substances, such as sodium chloride, and you cannot tell the difference between natural and artificial sources. Other flavours are due to more complex substances, such as vanilla flavouring.
Ice cream contains vanilla flavouring. Artificial vanilla is usually a substance called ethyl vanillin. This has a much stronger taste and smell than natural vanilla. It is also cheaper to make than natural vanilla, which has to be extracted from vanilla beans. People with a good sense of taste can tell the difference between the two types of vanilla, because the natural vanilla is a mixture of substances.
For the exam, you'll need to be able to recognise some of the hazard symbols used in chemistry and to explain what they mean. You may also be asked to give examples of chemicals that should be labelled with a particular hazard symbol, or suggest a suitable hazard symbol for a particular chemical.
The diagrams on this page show some of the common hazard symbols used in chemistry, and their meanings. These symbols may be in a triangle or a square, and a chemical container might be labelled with more than one hazard symbol.
Attacks and destroys living tissues, such as skin and eyes.
Concentrated solutions of strong acids such as
would be labelled with the corrosive symbol. Concentrated solutions of strong alkalis such as
would also be labelled this way. Anyone using a corrosive substance should wear gloves and eye protection, such as goggles or a face shield.
Not corrosive but will make the skin red or blister.
The dilute solutions of acids and alkalis that you normally use at school would be labelled with the irritant symbol. Anyone using an irritant substance should wear eye protection such as goggles, and they should take care to wash any spills off their skin immediately.
Can cause death, eg if swallowed, breathed in or absorbed by skin.
would be labelled with the toxic symbol. Anyone using a toxic chemical would need to take great care. They should wear gloves and eye protection, and they may wear a mask over their mouth and nose or handle the chemical in a fume cupboard.
Similar to toxic substances but not as dangerous.
would be labelled with the harmful symbol. Anyone using a harmful substance should wear eye protection such as goggles, and they should take care to wash any spills off their skin immediately.
would be labelled with the highly flammable symbol. In addition to the normal precautions of wearing eye protection, anyone using a highly flammable substance should take care to keep it away from flames and sparks, and also from oxidising substances.
Provides oxygen to make other substances burn more fiercely.
would be labelled with the oxidising symbol. Oxidising substances do not burn themselves but they provide oxygen for flammable substances to burn. In addition to the normal precautions of wearing eye protection, anyone using an oxidising substance should take care to keep it away from flammable substances, including clothing.
Some compounds break down when heated, forming simpler substances. Reactions like these are called thermal decomposition reactions.
Carbonates release carbon dioxide gas when they are heated. Here are the equations for the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate (found in chalk, limestone and marble):
calcium carbonate → calcium oxide + carbon dioxide
Calcium is a reactive metal, so its carbonate is relatively stable and needs a lot of heat to decompose it. Copper, however, is much less reactive and its carbonate needs little heat to decompose it. Here are the equations for the thermal decomposition of copper carbonate (notice that a metal oxide is formed, just as it was with calcium carbonate):
Copper carbonate → copper oxide + carbon dioxide
Hydrogen carbonates also break down to release carbon dioxide when heated, but different products are formed. Here are the equations for the thermal decomposition of sodium hydrogen carbonate:
sodium hydrogen carbonate → sodium carbonate + carbon dioxide + water
. It reacts with acids in the powder to release carbon dioxide gas. This makes batter or sponge mixtures rise when they are cooked.
You need to be able to identify some uses of some common compounds.
dissolves in water to make an alkaline solution
window cleaning products, vinegar, crisps and sauces

Women are expected to be good wives and mothers and to follow the example of Sita, the wife of Lord Rama. The role of the mother has always been given a very high status in Hinduism. The mother goddess is associated with everything that is good and protective. Mothers are respected because the mother is the first teacher of the child, and she has a special role to play taking charge of worship in the home.
Nevertheless, there are varying attitudes and opinions about the role of women.
Some Hindus have a traditional attitude. They think women should be at home looking after the family, and that they should accept the authority of their husband. Some aspects of Hinduism reinforce this idea because men are given greater importance:
only men can act as priests at religious festivals
only boys can receive a sacred thread in the
Some Hindu teachings reinforce this too by suggesting that a woman who performs her duties will be reborn as a man.
Hindu women are expected to marry and, if possible, to have sons. Women are often viewed as the property of their fathers when they are young, then of their husbands, and then their sons. These men have a duty to protect the woman but she is not seen as equally independent.
Modern Hindus often have less traditional ideas about the role of women and education for women is becoming more common. India and Pakistan have both had female Prime Ministers.

2680	5	"All religions teach the difference between good and evil, but have different beliefs about evil and suffering.
Religion has a great deal to say about 'good' and 'evil'. Religious leaders and sacred texts all encourage believers to live 'good' lives. The problem of evil and suffering is one of the commonest reasons people give for not believing in G-d.
- suffering caused by events that have nothing to do with humans, and which are to do with the way the world is, eg, natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, floods or earthquakes
- suffering caused by humans acting in a way that is considered morally wrong eg, bullying, murder, rape, theft or terrorism the
Human evil and natural evil can often work together, with human evil making natural evil worse – or better! For example, the suffering caused by an earthquake or floods can be made worse by people looting – it can be made more bearable by people showing compassion and making personal sacrifices to help those who are suffering.
It is important to remember that 'evil' is a cause of suffering; 'suffering' is a result of evil.
Many Jewish thinkers say that it is not possible to know what evil is. It is more important to ask what people should do about it.
What does Judaism teach about good and evil?

2803	5	"There are over a hundred elements. All substances are made from one or more of these elements. The modern periodic table is a way of showing how these elements can be ordered.
Before the development of the modern periodic table, there were other attempts to arrange the elements in a useful way, by scientists such as Döbereiner, Newlands and Mendeleev.
The modern periodic table is a chart containing the elements arranged in order of
, contains elements with similar properties. A horizontal row is called a
. The atomic number of the elements in a period increases from left to right along the row.
Before the development of the modern periodic table, there were other attempts to arrange the elements in a useful way. For example, Döbereiner arranged groups of three elements with similar properties into ‘triads'. Newlands and Mendeleev arranged the elements in order of increasing relative atomic mass.
Some attempts at arranging the elements were more successful than others. Newlands did not leave any space for undiscovered elements but Mendeleev did. Using his table, Mendeleev was able to successfully predict the properties of three elements that were not yet discovered.
A German scientist called Johann Döbereiner put forward his
in 1817. Each of Döbereiner's triads was a group of three elements. The appearance and reactions of the elements in a triad were similar to each other.
At this time, scientists had begun to find out the relative atomic masses of the elements. Döbereiner discovered that the
The relative atomic mass is the number of times heavier an atom is compared to one twelth of a carbon-12 atom.
of the middle element in each triad was close to the average of the relative atomic masses of the other two elements. This gave other scientists a clue that relative atomic masses were important when arranging the elements.
A table in order of relative atomic mass
An English scientist called John Newlands put forward his
in 1864. He arranged all the elements known at the time into a table in order of
The relative atomic mass is the number of times heavier an atom is compared to one twelth of a carbon-12 atom.
. When he did this, he found that each element was similar to the element eight places further on. For example, starting at Li, Be is the second element, B is the third and Na is the eighth element.
Newlands' table showed a repeating or periodic pattern of properties, but it had problems. For example, he put iron in the same group as oxygen and sulphur, which are two non-metals. As a result, his table was not accepted by other scientists.
Another table in order of relative atomic mass
In 1869, just five years after John Newlands put forward his law of octaves, a Russian chemist called Dmitri Mendeleev published a periodic table. Mendeleev also arranged the elements known at the time in order of
The relative atomic mass is the number of times heavier an atom is compared to one twelth of a carbon-12 atom.
, but he did some other things that made his table much more successful.
He realised that the physical and chemical properties of elements were related to their atomic mass in a 'periodic' way, and arranged them so that groups of elements with similar properties fell into vertical columns in his table.
Sometimes this method of arranging elements meant there were gaps in his horizontal rows or 'periods'. But instead of seeing this as a problem, Mendeleev thought it simply meant that the elements which belonged in the gaps had not yet been discovered.
He was also able to work out the atomic mass of the missing elements, and so predict their properties. And when they
discovered, Mendeleev turned out to be right. For example, he predicted the properties of an undiscovered element that should fit below aluminium in his table. When this element, called gallium, was discovered in 1875, its properties were found to be close to Mendeleev's predictions. Two other predicted elements were later discovered, lending further credit to Mendeleev's table.
Mendeleev's table needed one important modification before it became the modern periodic table – the use of
All atoms of the same element contain the same number of particles called protons
, and this is called the element's atomic number.
Mendeleev put the elements in order of their relative atomic mass, and this gave him some problems. For example, iodine has a lower relative atomic mass than tellurium, so it should come before tellurium in Mendeleev's table. In order to get iodine in the same group as other elements with similar properties such as fluorine, chlorine and bromine, he had to put it after tellurium, so breaking his own rules.
as the organising principle was first proposed by the British chemist Henry Moseley in 1913, and it solved anomalies like this one. Iodine has a higher atomic number than tellurium. So, even though he didn't know why, Mendeleev was right to place it after tellurium after all!

1643	4	"> Decimals - Adding and subtracting decimals
When adding and subtracting decimals, remember is to keep the decimal points in line in the question and the answer.
David is doing some DIY. He buys a 2m length of wood. He needs to cut two pieces of wood - one of length 0.6m and one of length 1.02m.
What is the total length of wood that David needs to cut?
So the total length of wood that David needs to cut is 1.62m.
You can add zeros to the end of a decimal without affecting its value, so 0.6 is the same as 0.60.
David originally had 2m of wood. What is the length of the piece of wood that is left?
David cut off 1.62m, so we need to calculate 2 - 1.62
So there is 0.38m of wood left.
Connect the dots with this decimals activity.

2432	5	"Making decisions on moral issues is not easy. Religion helps followers to make decisions that are pleasing to God and create a society where people respect and care for each other
People draw on a variety of sources of authority to help them make a decision. For example:
religious leaders and the official teaching of their religion
There are two types of morality that affect the decisions people make – absolute morality and relative moraility.
If you believe in absolute morality you will have faith that there is a right course of action to take in a moral dilemma, which is true in all situations regardless of culture, religious tradition, time or age.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment ‘Do not kill’? They would try to make sure that they were not involved in any killing, which would affect their views on issues such as war, abortion and euthanasia. They would say that these actions are wrong in all circumstances.
If you believe in relative morality you would agree that different courses of action might be needed in different situations.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment ‘Do not kill’? They would agree that killing is wrong, but would look at a range of other issues as well and say that sometimes killing might be necessary in a particular situation, such as abortion, if continuing the pregnancy would result in the birth of a very disabled child, or if the mother had been raped.
Contraception or ‘birth control’ is used for a variety of reasons:
when pregnancy might harm the mental or physical condition of the mother
to limit the number of children people have to ensure they don't damage living standards or affect other children
to prevent pregnancy in people who do not want a child at this stage in their lives
Islam teaches that life is a sacred gift from
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He pleases.
Allah bestows females upon whom He pleases and He bestows males upon whom He pleases; or He mixes them, males and females; and He makes whom He pleases barren.
For these reasons contraception has been seen to be against the teachings of the
(the Divine Book revealed to the Prophet Muhammad).
In recent years, the Conference on Islam and Family Planning has agreed that contraception can be used if:
there is a chance of a child being born disabled
the family do not have the money to bring up a child
Abortion is the artificial ending of the life of a foetus in the womb (uterus). A natural abortion is called a miscarriage. Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.
An abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies:
the life or physical health of the mother is at risk
the mental health of the mother is at risk
there is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled
Where the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born.
In 1974 119,000 legal abortions were carried out in England and Wales, by 2006 this figure had risen to 193,700.
Abortion is not permitted within Islam unless it’s to save the mother’s life. Even if a pregnant woman is sentenced to death, this cannot be carried out until the baby has been born.
The later the abortion takes place the worse it is thought to be. Some Muslims believe that for the first four months of pregnancy the woman has greater rights than the foetus but that after this time they are equal.
One of the reasons that Islam is very opposed to abortion is because, before the time of
, unwanted female children were often buried alive in Arabia. Islam teaches:
Do not destroy your offspring for fear of poverty, it is We Who provide for them and for you. Surely, destroying them is a great sin.

Marco also won the Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma (California). He recently slowed down long enough to talk to
So, how fast do you actually go?
[My] top speed [is] 240 [miles per hour].
How did you get started in racing?
I started at 9 years old. So it’s go-karts. Believe it or not, those things aren’t toys. It gets pretty competitive. The first time I ever sat in a go-kart, I was just going to have a go and see basically if I had it or not. Of course, the media was everywhere. There were so many cameras there, I couldn’t even see the track.
How did you deal with all the attention at such a young age?
It was very overwhelming. I got to the point where I was winning races, but I wasn’t enjoying myself. I would win a race and come away from the day saying that’s what I needed to do, rather than enjoy it. I just took a little time off and then went crazy not driving, so I had to come back for myself.
What don’t you like about coming from such a famous racing family?
You have a lot expected of you because of all their accomplishments, but I’m just going to go have fun with it. You set your own goals.
How did it feel to pass your father in the Indy 500?

Scientists are amazed by the discovery. ""By itself, the villa is a notable finding, but it acquires even more value because it is the place where one of the greatest poets in Rome lived,"" explained Gaetano Messineo, one of the scientists at the dig.
City officials in Rome plan to put up a building around Ovid's ancient villa to protect it. But the area will not look as it did in Ovid's time. A dump and a four-lane highway now block the views of the Tiber River that Ovid wrote about in his poetry.

Six Portuguese (POR-chuh-geez) water dogs joined the Giants baseball team last summer. The dog team is known as B.A.R.K. That stands for Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps.
B.A.R.K.'s job is to bring back home-run balls that go out of the ballpark. But this is not as easy as it sounds. The Giant's ballpark is right next to San Francisco Bay in California. Home-run balls hit to right field usually go into the bay.
The B.A.R.K. team rides around the bay in a motorboat. When a ball lands in the bay, a B.A.R.K. dog dives into the water and brings back the ball.
The Giants founded the dog team with help from Pets In Need, a local animal shelter. During baseball games, workers from Pets In Need are at the ballpark trying to find homes for the shelter's animals. Pets In Need also sells the home-run balls to fans and uses the money to help its animals.
Besides being among America's favorite pets, some dogs have jobs.
Specially trained dogs work for the U.S. government. They can sniff out illegal drugs in suitcases.

Experts have also warned that tourists visiting Machu Picchu are damaging the Inca ruins. In recent years, tourists have started small fires and have littered the Machu Picchu area.
The government of Peru, however, disagreed with the warnings. ""Machu Picchu won't collapse,"" said one government official.
The official said that Machu Picchu has lasted for more than 500 years. He added that he doesn't see why landslides or tourism would destroy the city anytime soon.
The Incas built Machu Picchu sometime around 1460. The blocks used to build Machu Picchu were wedged so tightly together that a razor blade cannot fit between the stones. The ruins include about 200 stone buildings, including palaces, temples, and small homes.
The Incas were a South American Indian people who ruled one of the largest and richest empires on the continent. By 1532, the Incas ruled an area that stretched for 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America. The Inca empire included parts of what are now Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.
The Incas were skilled in farming and in building stone structures and roads. They were also skilled craftspeople, making many fine gold and silver ornaments. They studied the stars and knew how to predict the seasons of the year.
Spanish soldiers, led by Francisco Pizarro, attacked and conquered the Incas in 1532.

12	3	"Scientists recently discovered three previously unknown species of mouse lemurs. The find is important, because the numbers of lemurs left in the wild is dwindling.
Scientists found the lemurs on Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to more than 30 species of lemurs. Most lemurs are the size of small rodents, but some can grow to be as large as a medium-sized dog. Lemurs are usually
animals, which means they mostly sleep during the day and come out at night.
The discovery surprised scientists. ""It's incredibly rare to discover a new species of primate, let alone three new species,"" said Steven Goodman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.
Lemurs live only in the island nations of Madagascar and Comoros.
The smallest lemur weighs about 1 ounce.
The newly discovered species live only in the rain forests along Madagascar's west coast. They weigh a few ounces and eat beetles, fruits, and plants.
All lemurs on Madagascar are in trouble, however. Scientists fear that lemurs are in danger of becoming extinct.
One threat is from people cutting down the trees in which lemurs live. The trees are being cleared to create farmland. Another threat to lemurs comes from hunters who are trapping the primates for food.
To protect lemurs and the rain forests in which they live, wildlife officials in Madagascar have set up special parks and nature reserves. Loggers and hunters cannot cut down the trees or hunt the animals in the nature reserves.
Scientists hope that the special areas are large enough to protect all the species of lemurs that are living today. Scientists are especially concerned because there may be undiscovered species that need protection. ""So many areas of Madagascar haven't been [explored],"" said Dean Gibson of the Duke University Primate Center. ""I think there are more [species] to find.""

How many planets are in our solar system? If you said nine, you might not be right. A new discovery might prove that Pluto is not a planet after all.
Scientists discovered an object at the edge of our solar system. It is the biggest object found in the solar system since Pluto was discovered in 1930.

Once every eight days, she wakes up before dawn and treks down a hill from her run-down shack to a pumping station to beg for water. She stands in line with as many as 150 other people. When her turn finally comes, she gets aboard a tanker truck full of brownish, smelly liquid.
The truck then climbs the hill and pours the water into a dumpster and six barrels. Martinez and her family use that water to bathe, clean, and wash. Although the water is free, it is not

2474	5	"Crude oil is a mixture of compounds called hydrocarbons. Many useful materials can be produced from crude oil. It can be separated into different fractions using fractional distillation, and some of these can be used as fuels. Unfortunately, there are environmental consequences when fossil fuels such as crude oil and its products are used.
Most of the compounds in crude oil are hydrocarbons. This means that they only contain hydrogen and carbon atoms, joined together by chemical bonds. There are different types of hydrocarbon, but most of the ones in crude oil are alkanes.
The alkanes are a family of hydrocarbons that share the same general formula. This is:
The general formula means that the number of hydrogen atoms in an alkane is double the number of carbon atoms, plus two. For example, methane is CH
. Alkane molecules can be represented by displayed formulae in which each atom is shown as its symbol (
) and the chemical bonds between them by a straight line.
Notice that the molecular models on the right show that the bonds are not really at 90º.
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons. This means that their carbon atoms are joined to each other by single bonds. This makes them relatively unreactive, apart from their reaction with oxygen in the air, which we call burning or combustion.
Boiling point and state at room temperature
Hydrocarbons have different boiling points, and can be either solid, liquid or gas at room temperature:
Small hydrocarbons with only a few carbon atoms have low boiling points and are gases.
Hydrocarbons with between five and 12 carbon atoms are usually liquids.
Large hydrocarbons with many carbon atoms have high boiling points and are solids.
Distillation is a process that can be used to separate a pure liquid from a mixture of liquids. It works when the liquids have different boiling points. Distillation is commonly used to
separate ethanol (the alcohol in alcoholic drinks) from water
Distillation process to separate ethanol from water
Step 1 - water and ethanol solution are heated
Distillation process to separate ethanol from water
Step 2 - the ethanol evaporates first, cools, then condenses
Distillation process to separate ethanol from water
Step 3 - the water left evaporates, cools, then condenses
The mixture is heated in a flask. Ethanol has a lower boiling point than water so it evaporates first. The ethanol vapour is then cooled and condensed inside the condenser to form a pure liquid. The thermometer shows the boiling point of the pure ethanol liquid. When all the ethanol has evaporated from the solution, the temperature rises and the water evaporates.
This is the sequence of events in distillation:
heating → evaporating → cooling → condensing
Fractional distillation differs from distillation only in that it separates a mixture into a
. A tall column is fitted above the mixture, with several condensers coming off at different heights. The column is hot at the bottom and cool at the top. Substances with high boiling points condense at the bottom and substances with low boiling points condense at the top. Like distillation, fractional distillation works because the different substances in the mixture have different boiling points.
Because they have different boiling points, the substances in crude oil can be separated using fractional distillation. The crude oil is evaporated and its vapours allowed to condense at different temperatures in the fractionating column. Each fraction contains hydrocarbon molecules with a similar number of carbon atoms.
The diagram below summarises the main fractions from crude oil and their uses, and the trends in properties. Note that the gases condense at the top of the column, the liquids in the middle and the solids stay at the bottom.
The main fractions include refinery gases, gasoline (petrol), naphtha, kerosene, diesel oil, fuel oil, and a residue that contains bitumen. These fractions are mainly used as fuels, although they do have other uses too.
Hydrocarbons with small molecules make better fuels than hydrocarbons with large molecules because they are volatile, flow easily and are easily ignited.
Fuels burn when they react with oxygen in the air. The hydrogen in hydrocarbons is oxidised to water (remember that water, H
O, is an oxide of hydrogen). If there is plenty of air, we get complete combustion and the carbon in hydrocarbons is oxidised to carbon dioxide:
hydrocarbon + oxygen    →    water + carbon dioxide
If there is insufficient air for complete combustion, we get incomplete combustion instead. The hydrogen is still oxidised to water, but instead of carbon dioxide we get carbon monoxide. Particles of carbon, seen as soot or smoke, are also released.
Most hydrocarbon fuels naturally contain some sulfur compounds. When the fuel burns, the sulfur it contains is oxidised to sulfur dioxide.
Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
The combustion of a fuel may release several gases into the atmosphere, including:
These products may be harmful to the environment.
Sulfur dioxide is produced when fuels that contain sulfur compounds burn. It is a gas with a sharp, choking smell. When sulfur dioxide dissolves in water droplets in clouds, it makes the rain more acidic than normal. This is called
Acid rain reacts with metals and rocks such as limestone. Buildings and statues are damaged as a result. Acid rain damages the waxy layer on the leaves of trees and makes it more difficult for trees to absorb the minerals they need for healthy growth. They may die as a result. Acid rain also makes rivers and lakes too acidic for some aquatic life to survive.
Sulfur dioxide can be removed from waste gases after combustion of the fuel. This happens in power stations. The sulfur dioxide is treated with powdered limestone to form calcium sulfate. This can be used to make plasterboard for lining interior walls, so turning a harmful product into a useful one.
Sulfur can be removed from fuels at the oil refinery. This makes the fuel more expensive to produce, but it prevents sulfur dioxide being produced. You may have noticed 'low sulfur' petrol and diesel on sale at filling stations.
Carbon dioxide from burning fuels causes global warming, a process capable of changing the world’s climate significantly.
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th century
The temperature of the earth has risen over the years
As you can see from the graphs, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased steadily over the past 150 years, and so has the average global temperature.
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs heat energy and prevents it escaping from the Earth’s surface into space. The greater the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more heat energy is absorbed and the hotter the Earth becomes.
Heat is reflected back from the Earth’s surface
Heat is absorbed by carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas) and as a result becomes trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere
The Earth becomes hotter as a result
A rise of just a few degrees in world temperatures will have a dramatic impact on the climate:
Global weather patterns will change, causing drought in some places and flooding in others.
Melting of polar ice caps will raise sea levels, causing increased coastal erosion and flooding of low-lying land – including land where major cities lie.
The Triftgletscher glacier, Switzerland, 2003. As the glacier melts further, the lake's water level rises.
Tiny particles that are released when fuels are burned cause global dimming. Like global warming, this process may change rainfall patterns around the world.
The amount of sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface has decreased by about 2 per cent every ten years, because more sunlight is being reflected back into space. The particles from burning fuels reflect sunlight, and they also cause more water droplets to form in the clouds. This makes the clouds better at reflecting sunlight back into space.
It is likely that global dimming has hidden some of the effects of global warming, by stopping some of the Sun’s energy reaching the Earth’s surface in the first place. Governments around the world are introducing controls on pollution. There is the possibility that as the air becomes less polluted by smoke and soot, global dimming will decrease, causing the effects of global warming to become more obvious.

Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.

Cigarettes contain many chemicals, including a chemical called nicotine, which studies have proved is addictive.
For many years, scientists believed it took a fairly long time for smokers to become addicted to nicotine. Last year, however, a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts showed that young smokers can become addicted to nicotine in only a few days or weeks.
The new study worries many doctors. ""This is particularly disturbing, given that each day, over 4,800 [U.S.] teens smoke their first cigarette. That's 1.7 million children annually,"" said Dr. Joseph DiFranza, who led the study. He added that those ""kids will take about 20 years on average to break this addiction.

2769	5	"Islam: beliefs about care of the planet
The relationship between human beings and the earth is increasingly complicated and urgent. Every day there are stories about pollution, global warming and animal species facing extinction. Religion is responding with views on the enviroment and our responsibility for it.
Although human beings are seen as the most intelligent life form on earth, they are responsible for almost all the
done to the planet. If we imagined the earth is aged 46, all the damage done has taken place in the last 60 seconds of the earth's life.
That which is read or recited. The Divine Book revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Allah's final revelation to humankind.
of the world. Human beings are on the world as trustees or ‘vice-regents’ - they are told to look after the world for Allah and for the future:
The Earth is green and beautiful, and Allah has appointed you his stewards over it. The whole earth has been created a place of worship, pure and clean. Whoever plants a tree and diligently looks after it until it matures and bears fruit is rewarded. If a Muslim plants a tree or sows a field and humans and beasts and birds eat from it, all of it is
, Muslims are instructed to look after the environment and not to damage it:
Devote thyself single-mindedly to the Faith, and thus follow the nature designed by Allah, the nature according to which He has fashioned mankind. There is no altering the creation of Allah.
Muslims have to look after the earth because it is all Allah’s creation and it is part of a human’s duty to Allah:
Allah is He Who raised up the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then He settled Himself on the Throne, and constrained the sun and the moon to serve you; each planet pursues its course during an appointed term. He regulates it all and expounds the Signs, that you may have firm belief in the meeting with your Lord. He it is Who spread out the earth and made therein firmly fixed mountains and rivers, and of fruits of every kind He has made pairs. He causes the night to cover the day. In all this, verily, are signs doer a people who reflect.
Because of this passage, people see themselves as being
for the world which Allah created and they have to make their own decisions about how to do this.
In 1986, HRH Prince Philip, then President of the WWF International invited five leaders of five of the major religions of the world -
- to meet to discuss how their faiths could help
The meeting took place in Assisi in Italy, because it was the birth place of St Francis, the Catholic saint of ecology. From this meeting arose key statements by the five faiths outlining their own distinctive traditions and approach to the care for nature.
In the Assisi Declarations on Nature the Muslim statement was:
The Islamic name for God in the Arabic language
is Unity; and His Unity is also reflected in the unity of mankind, and the unity of man and nature. His trustees are responsible for maintaining the unity of His creation, the integrity of the Earth, its flora and fauna, its wildlife and natural environment. Unity cannot be had by discord, by setting one need against another or letting one end predominate over another; it is maintained by balance and harmony. There Muslims say that Islam is the middle path and we will be answerable for how we have walked this path, how we have maintained balance and harmony in the whole of creation around us.
So unity, trusteeship and accountability, that is Tawhid,
Everlasting life after death - the afterlife.
, the three central concepts of Islam, are also the pillars of the environmental ethics of Islam. They constitute the basic values taught by the
That which is read or recited. The Divine Book revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Allah's final revelation to humankind.
. It is these values which led
, the Prophet of Islam, to say: ‘Whoever plants a tree and diligently looks after it until it matures and bears fruit is rewarded.'
For all these reasons Muslims see themselves as having a responsibility towards the world and the environment, all of which are the creations of Allah.
Unlike many other religions, Muslims do not have any specific festivals in which they give thanks for the harvest or the world. Instead they give thanks to Allah regularly for his creation.
In order to separate Islam from other religions, the Islamic year is only 354 days, this means that the months and festivals happen at a different time each year and so there is no particular festival which falls during a period of harvest.

2232	5	"Making decisions on moral issues is not easy. Religion helps followers to make decisions that are pleasing to God and create a society where people respect and care for each other
People draw on a variety of sources of authority to help them make a decision. For example:
religious leaders and the official teaching of their religion
There are two types of morality that affect the decisions people make – absolute morality and relative morality.
If you believe in absolute morality you will have faith that there is a right course of action to take in a moral dilemma, which is true in all situations regardless of culture, religious tradition, time or age.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment ‘Do not kill’? They would try to make sure that they were not involved in any killing, which would affect their views on issues such as war, abortion and euthanasia. They would say that these actions are wrong in all circumstances.
If you believe in relative morality you would agree that different courses of action might be needed in different situations.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment ‘Do not kill’? They would agree that killing is wrong, but would look at a range of other issues as well and say that sometimes killing might be necessary in a particular situation, such as abortion, if continuing the pregnancy would result in the birth of a very disabled child, or if the mother had been raped.
Contraception or ‘birth control’ is used for a variety of reasons:
when pregnancy might harm the mental or physical condition of the mother
to limit the number of children people have to ensure they don't damage living standards or affect other children
to prevent pregnancy in people who do not want a child at this stage in their lives
The various Christian churches have different views on contraception:
says that the use of contraception is against natural law (which means it is not in keeping with human nature). It is natural that conception may happen with intercourse and therefore this should not be prevented. The only form of contraception permitted is the ‘rhythm method’ where intercourse takes place at a time when the woman is least fertile.
churches (eg, the Anglican Church and the Methodist Church) now see the use of contraception within marriage as a responsible way of planning a family. It allows sex to be enjoyed without the fear of an unwanted pregnancy.
Abortion is the artificial ending of the life of a foetus in the womb (uterus). A natural abortion is called a miscarriage. Abortion has been legal in England, Scotland and Wales since 1967 when The Abortion Act was passed. A new upper time limit of 24 weeks was introduced in 1990 under The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.
An abortion may be carried out if one of the following conditions applies:
the life or physical health of the mother is at risk
the mental health of the mother is at risk
there is a reasonable chance that the child will be born seriously disabled
Where the mental health of the mother is at risk, or her family will suffer if the pregnancy continues, the latest termination date is 24 weeks. There is no upper limit if the life or physical health of the mother is at risk, or if there is a reasonable chance of a seriously disabled child being born.
In 1974 119,000 legal abortions were carried out in England and Wales, by 2006 this figure had risen to 193,700.
The Christian Church teaches that life is a sacred gift from God:
Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
Christian teaching on abortion is complex. An early Christian document, the Didache, condemns it:
You shall not kill by abortion the fruit of the womb.
The Bible appears to say that life begins when the baby is in the mother’s womb:
For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.
opposes abortion in every instance. However, if life saving treatment given to a pregnant woman results in the unavoidable loss of a foetus, but saves the mother, then this is accepted and known as 'double effect'.
Roman Catholic teaching is that the foetus is a human being. This is clearly expressed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) which states:
From the first moment of his(her) existence, a human being must be recognised as having the rights of a person – among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life
When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
(Quakers) believe that although abortion should not be encouraged, the life of the unborn child cannot be seen as more important than that of the mother.
movement generally argues that life becomes human life at the point of conception. It says that abortion should not be allowed, but most would allow an abortion if the mother’s life was at risk or if pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.
movement generally argues that human life begins much later in pregnancy, or at birth. There are many points of view among pro-choicers, but fundamentally they think that the woman should have full control over what happens to her body.

Recreational drugs, such as alcohol and tobacco, are taken by people because they like the effects they have on their bodies, but they are addictive. Other change-causing substances, both legal and illegal, include solvents, painkillers, sedatives and stimulants. Opiates (such as morphine) are useful for pain-relief in terminally ill patients, but they can be misused as illegal recreational drugs that are very addictive.
Drugs are substances that cause changes to the body. Some drugs can help the body, but others can harm it. Some
drugs can be extracted from natural sources
and their existence has been known about for a long time. For example, willow bark is known to have been used by the ancient Greeks to help cure fevers and pains. It was later discovered that the active ingredient was salicylic acid. This was modified by chemists into the substance we call aspirin, which is less irritating to the stomach than salicylic acid.
Doctor is injecting a potential vaccine for an infection
New medical drugs have to be tested before they can be prescribed for patients. They are tested in a laboratory to check that they are not toxic, and later they are trialled using
. At this point, any potential side effects should show themselves. Most substances do not pass all the tests and trials, so
Medical drug trials are not without risk. Sometimes very severe and unexpected side-effects appear.
from 2006 about a drugs trial that left six volunteers very ill.
Warnings such as 'Smoking can cause a slow and painful death' are used to deter people from smoking
About 114,000 people die every year as a result of smoking-related illnesses. All cigarettes sold now carry a prominent health warning.
Smoking during pregnancy is very dangerous. It reduces the amount of oxygen available to the growing foetus. This leads to an increased risk of
Cigarettes contain about 4,000 different chemicals, many of which are harmful to the body.
Nicotine is the addictive substance in tobacco smoke. It reaches the brain within 20 seconds and creates a dependency so that smokers become addicted.
the red protein found in red blood cells that transports oxygen round the body
reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen
. This puts extra strain on the circulatory system, and can cause an increased risk of heart disease and strokes.
. Tobacco smoke contains many carcinogens, including tar. Smoking increases the risk of lung cancer, mouth cancer and throat cancer.
The images above compare a healthy lung to a smoker’s lung. Tar deposits can be seen clearly in the smoker’s lung.
The alcohol in alcoholic drinks such as wines, beer and spirits is
. It is a depressant. This means that it slows down signals in the nerves and brain.
Small amounts of alcohol help people to relax, but greater amounts lead to a
. Drinkers of alcohol may not realise how much they are consuming, and fall ill as a result. They may become unconscious, and may even fall into a coma.
. Alcohol may also cause weight gain, and it is addictive.
from 2006 about the dangers of binge drinking
Solvents are chemicals found in glue, paint, nail varnish, gas canisters, lighter fuel, and some cleaning fluids, and can cause changes in the body if breathed in in significant amounts. In such a case, solvents are usually depressants, like alcohol. They act on the central nervous system and muscles.
They have short-term effects such as distorted perceptions, hallucinations and personality changes. Long-term effects of solvent abuse include damage to the brain, lungs, liver and kidneys. This can lead to heart attack and sudden death.
Drugs can affect nerves impulses, reaction times and behaviour.
Stimulants include caffeine - found in cola drinks and coffee, cannabis and amphetamines. They increase the transmission of signals from one nerve cell to the next. This increases alertness, heart rate and breathing rate. However, in the longer term, they can produce 'highs' and then extreme 'lows' or even depression. They can be addictive because the body needs a constant top-up to maintain the effect.
Sedatives include alcohol and barbiturates - drugs prescribed by a doctor to help people sleep or to relieve the symptoms of stress. They slow down the nervous system and decrease reaction times.
Painkillers or analgesics include paracetamol, aspirin, heroin and morphine. They block nerve impulses from the painful part of the body, or block nerve impulses travelling to the part of the brain responsible for perceiving pain.
Paracetamol is an effective painkiller but an overdose is very dangerous. An overdose damages the liver and can cause death.
Morphine is a powerful painkilling drug that acts directly on the central nervous system. It is called an opiate because it comes from the opium poppy. It is prescribed to relieve severe chronic pain, such as cancer pain, and after severe injury or surgery. Morphine has side effects such as drowsiness and blurred vision, and it is very addictive.
Heroin is manufactured from morphine and is even more dangerously addictive. But it is useful to treat severe pain in terminally ill patients, and it causes fewer unpleasant side effects than morphine. Both substances are used illegally as recreational drugs, and this is very dangerous.
Cannabis is an illegal drug that can be smoked, producing feelings of well-being. But like tobacco it can cause lung cancer and bronchitis. Unlike tobacco, it can cause permanent damage to the mental health of its users. Research has shown that cannabis has some useful painkilling properties, but it is illegal to prescribe it for this use.
All drugs have the potential to damage our health, because they change chemical processes in the body. Addictive recreational drugs may damage our health indirectly by reducing the amount of money available to buy food, and by placing users in dangerous situations. Injecting any drug with a needle and syringe that someone else has used may lead to a number of diseases from infected blood, including HIV and hepatitis. Users of illegal drugs may turn to crime to pay for their habit, and this affects the lives of other people.
A research report in 2006 classified various drugs according to their health and social risks, without reference to whether they are legal or not. In the report, heroin and cocaine are the most dangerous two drugs, alcohol is the fifth most dangerous and tobacco is ninth.

Forget about traveling to Africa to go on a safari. If some scientists have their way, people may be able to spot lions, cheetahs, and elephants roaming the
of North America. The Great Plains lies in the center of North America. The region extends from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and from Canada to Texas.
A team of scientists recently proposed the bold plan to save endangered animals from extinction in Africa.
A team of scientists wants to introduce African animals such as lions, elephants, and cheetahs to the United States. The goal of their bold plan is to help save endangered animals from extinction in Africa. Many animal
there are disappearing. A habitat is the place where a plant or an animal lives.
The African animals they want to relocate to the Great Plains are the closest living relatives of animals that lived in the United States long ago. Some of those ancient animals include saber-toothed cats and
A mastodon was an elephant-like creature with long tusks. Those animals lived until the last
ended, about 10,000 years ago. An ice age is a period of time when large sheets of ice covered Earth.
People who oppose the plan argue that releasing species into new environments could cause destruction. Cattle and sheep ranchers are also concerned that the wild animals will devour their herds.
Many scientists say that relocating African animals is a bad idea because there are already many species that need protection in North America. Scientist Donald Grayson adds, ""Why introduce … [elephants] and lions when there are North American species that could benefit from the same kind of effort?""

Most electricity is made in power stations by burning fuels. Transformers are used in the National Grid to reduce energy losses from the wires during transmission.
An electric current is produced when a magnet is moved into a coil of wire in a circuit. The direction of the current is reversed when the magnet is moved out of the coil. It can also be reversed if the other pole of the magnet is moved into the coil. Check your understanding of the

Notice that no current is induced when the magnet is still, even if it is inside the coil.
increase the number of turns on the coil
Batteries produce direct current, or DC, electricity. The current flows in the same direction all of the time, as shown by this typical voltage-time graph.
Generators produce alternating current, or AC, electricity. The current reverses direction regularly, as shown by this typical voltage-time graph.
Mains electricity is AC. It has a frequency of 50Hz - 50 cycles per second.
When a wire is moved in a magnetic field, the movement, magnetic field and current are all at right angles to each other. If the wire is moved in the opposite direction, the induced current also moves in the opposite direction.
One side of a coil in a generator moves up during one half-turn, and then down during the next half-turn. This means that, as a coil is rotated in a magnetic field, the induced current reverses direction every half-turn.
About three-quarters of the electricity which is generated in the UK comes from power stations that are fuelled by fossil fuels.
the fuel is burned to boil water to make steam
the spinning turbine turns a generator which produces electricity
the electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage
Power stations generate significant heat losses to the environment. Below is an energy transfer diagram for the generation of electricity from a fossil fuel such as coal:
Energy transfer for the generation of electricity from a fossil fuel
A transformer is an electrical device that changes the voltage of an AC supply. A transformer changes a high-voltage supply into a low-voltage one, or vice versa:
a transformer that increases the voltage is called a
a transformer that decreases the voltage is called a
Step-down transformers are used in mains adapters and rechargers for mobile phones and CD players.
When a current flows through a wire, some energy is lost as heat. The higher the current, the more heat is lost. To reduce these losses, the National Grid transmits electricity at a low current. This requires a high voltage.
Power stations produce electricity at 25,000V. Electricity is sent through the National Grid cables at 400,000V, 275,000V and 132,000V.
Step-up transformers at power stations produce the very high voltages needed to transmit electricity through the National Grid power lines. These high voltages are too dangerous to use in the home, so step-down transformers are used locally to reduce the voltage to safe levels.
The energy input and output of a power station can be summarised by this equation:
fuel energy input = waste energy output + electrical energy output
For a given input of energy from a fuel, the more waste energy output, the less electrical energy output.
How much electrical energy is output from an input of 1,000J if 600J is wasted?
fuel energy input = waste energy output + electrical energy output
= fuel energy input - waste energy output
efficiency = electrical energy output ÷ fuel energy input

The flag people call the Star-Spangled Banner survived a fierce battle in 1814. Today, it lies flat like a patient on an operating table. Time, dust, and light have damaged it. Though it is frayed and torn in spots, after three years of care, the old flag is near recovery.
A team of experts at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., has been cleaning the flag. The museum's goal is not to make the flag look new but to protect it and save its place in history.
The flag experts haven't been working on the national symbol behind closed doors. Museum visitors have been able to watch experts work on the flag through a glass wall.

The new space will allow experts to continue to care for the flag while it is on display for the public. The temperature and light will be controlled in the room to protect the flag. Zoidis expects the exhibit to be ready in 2006. She said, ""The flag represents the ideals of America-equality and liberty for all.""
The first printed edition of Star Spangled Banner, 1814.
During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem. That war was fought against Great Britain. On September 13, 1814, Key watched as British troops bombed Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland.
The flag flying over the fort survived the night. Key was so moved by the sight of the American flag that he wrote a poem that was later set to music. In 1931, Congress made the song the official national anthem.

Grizzly bears live in Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding forests. That area covers parts of the western states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Today, more than 550 grizzlies live there. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s!

The ability of a battery to supply electrical energy is called its
. The capacity of a battery is measured in amp-hours. This unit has the symbol
. You might also see battery capacity shown in milliamp-hours -
, especially on rechargeable batteries for mobile phones.
Here is the equation for working out a battery's capacity:
capacity = current supplied × length of time supplied
So, a battery that can supply 2 amps for 4 hours has a capacity of 2 × 4 = 8 Ah.
It is helpful to know how long a given battery should be able to supply electrical energy for. To do so, we re-arrange the equation above like this:
length of time supplied = capacity ÷ current supplied
How long can a 10 Ah battery supply 2 A of electricity?
length of time supplied = 10 ÷ 2   =   5 hours
How long can a 4 Ah battery supply 8 A of electricity?
length of time supplied = 4 ÷ 8   =   0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)
There are two main types of battery: non-rechargeable batteries and rechargeable batteries.
Ordinary 'dry-cell' batteries are non-rechargeable. As the reactants inside them become used up in chemical reactions, the output from these batteries gradually falls. Once all the reactants have been used up, these batteries go 'flat' and cannot supply electrical energy anymore.
Rechargeable batteries usually maintain a constant output until just before they go flat. They contain reactants that can be made again just by passing electricity through the products. Once the battery has gone flat, it can be connected to a recharger. This uses electrical energy to reverse the chemical reactions that happened in the battery while it was in use.
Car batteries are rechargeable batteries - they are constantly recharged while the car is moving, so the lights and horn will always work.
Mobile phones, many MP3 players and other portable devices use rechargeable batteries. They must be recharged at regular intervals. It is usually recommended that such batteries should almost be flat before recharging. This allows the battery to be fully charged again.
Advantages and disadvantages of rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries
expensive to use in the long run as more are needed (high cost / performance ratio)
cheap in the long run as they can be re-used (low cost / performance ratio)
disposal of many batteries creates a lot of chemical pollution
disposal of fewer batteries creates less chemical pollution
Technology has improved over time. These are some of the devices that have improved during the last few decades:
rechargeable batteries - smaller, higher capacity, faster recharge times
microprocessors or computer chips - smaller and faster
computer memory chips and disk drives - smaller, faster, higher capacity
The number of transistors on a single computer chip has increased hugely over the past 30 years or so
All these devices have also become cheaper as a result of improvements such as these:
computers have become small enough to carry around, instead of occupying a whole room
mobile phones have reduced in size and weight, remain on for longer and have more features
many household appliances are controlled by microprocessors
new devices have been invented, including digital cameras and MP3 players

136	3	"Students in Piscataway, New Jersey, have something many kids only dream of-- a rule that limits the amount of homework they are assigned.
Last October, the Piscataway Board of Education voted to limit the amount of homework kids get. For kids in elementary school, homework is limited to 30 minutes a weeknight. For kids in high school, the amount of homework is limited to two hours a weeknight.
In recent years, many U.S. parents have called for limits on the amount of assigned homework.
Those parents have argued that heavy loads of homework leave kids little time for other activities. In addition, some parents say that homework assignments are so tough that they have to hire tutors to help their kids with homework.
Before the school board in Piscataway acted, parents there had been concerned about the amount of homework assigned by teachers. ""[Kids] are in school for six-and-a-half hours a day,"" said parent Cheryl Weaver. ""They don't need to come home and do another two or three hours of homework. That's more than a full-time job.""
Many educators worry about cutting down on homework. They say that limiting homework could mean limiting learning.
Some educators say that even a light load of homework helps kids learn and do well in school. The Educational Resources Information Center the of U.S. Department of Education has released a report about homework and its impact on students.
Many companies across the United States have developed Web sites aimed at helping kids with their homework. Many of those Web companies hire teachers to help kids come up with the answers to questions. Here are two such sites.
According to the department's report, homework helps students in many ways. For example, homework helps students become interested in different subjects, teaches them responsibility, and improves their classroom work. In short, homework helps students do better in school and get better grades.
Some students agree with the experts. New York resident Kaitlin Ofman, 12, notes that although she sometimes has a lot of homework, she still feels that there is a benefit to doing it.
""I understand that homework is important,"" Kaitlin said. ""After we learn something in school, we might forget it if we [didn't] have any practice in it,"" she said.

The Tempest second key extract - Characters
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer.
Question: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts?
In the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband.
Miranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her.
She relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero.
In the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage.
Miranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character.
Throughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.

- if we exercise, we get hot and increase our sweating, so we lose more water and the blood plasma becomes more concentrated.
- the more we drink, the more we dilute the blood plasma. The kidneys respond by producing more dilute urine to get rid of the excess water.

improved communications brought much bigger (ultimately worldwide) audiences, and introduced composers to a wider variety of musical styles
composers drew on 'popular' influences such as ragtime, blues, jazz, folk music and popular dance styles
new techniques in recording, instrument making and amplification lead to new ways of music-making
New kinds of pitch and texture were widely experimented within this period.

The composer first arranges the 12 notes of the chromatic scale in any order of his or her choice. This becomes the note-row.
All 12 notes are of equal importance and they should appear in the order of the note-row, although they can be repeated.
As well as using the note-row in its original form, it may be used backwards (retrograde), upside down (inversion), or both backwards and upside down (retrograde inversion).
Each of these can be transposed to begin on any note of the chromatic scale.
