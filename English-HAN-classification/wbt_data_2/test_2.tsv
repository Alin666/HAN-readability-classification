The electricity was out for 48 hours in many places.Officials are investigating what caused the power failure. Aswent to press, officials said a power failure near Cleveland, Ohio, was the start of the problem. From there, the blackout raced through the northeast parts of the country, much like falling dominoes.

Preventing a repeat blackout involves fixing the way electricity flows through the power grid.

Inspired by the popular yellow wristbands introduced by champion cyclist Lance Armstrong to raise money for cancer research, Sydney had her own idea. ""I thought, 'Why can't we have one for diabetes?' "" she toldsince she was in kindergarten. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this disease. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no. That is a substance that the body needs to help convert, a sugar in food, into energy.With the help of her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, Sydney ordered blue wristbands with the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today.""The two friends started selling the wristbands in their New Jersey community to raise money for research aimed at curing diabetes. After only a month, they had sold 10,000 bracelets and donated the contributions to the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York City.The bracelets were in such high demand that the diabetes center began selling them on its Web site.

The gene is the unit of inheritance and different forms of the same gene are called alleles.Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder caused by a faulty allele.The Human Genome Project has worked out the human DNA sequence, and its data are useful for forensic science and medical research.studies that the cell's nucleus controls the activities of the cell. Look there if you need to remind yourself of animal and plant cells.Chromosomes are X-shaped objects found in theThe central part of an atom. It contains protons and neutrons, and has most of the mass of the atom.of most cells. They consist of long strands of a substance called deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA for short. A section of DNA that has the genetic code for making a particular protein is called a gene., and each chromosome may have several thousand genes. We inherit particular chromosomes through the egg of our mother and sperm of our father. The genes on those chromosomes carry the code that determines our physical characteristics, which are a combination of those of our two parents.in the DNA molecule carry the different codes needed for different amino acids. The code for a particular amino acid is made from three bases in a particular order. The animation shows the structure of DNA in more detail, but note that you do not need to know this for your examination.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production.- pronounced 'al-eels'. You inherit one allele for each gene from your father and one allele for each gene from your mother. For example, the gene for eye colour has an alleles for blue eye colour and an alleles for brown eye colour. Your eye colour will depend on the combination of alleles you have inherited from your parents.Diseases can be caused by a number of things, including:spontaneous degeneration of tissues eg multiple sclerosisSome diseases are inherited from our parents through our genes: they are called. They occur because of faulty alleles. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a genetic disorder.People with cystic fibrosis have inherited two faulty alleles, one from their father and one from their mother. They produce unusually thick and stickySlimy white protein, which lines the respiratory tract and alimentary canal.in their lungs and airways. Their lungs become congested with mucus, and they are more likely to get respiratory infections. Daily physiotherapy helps to relieve congestion, whileSubstances that kill bacteria and fungal infections.are used to fight infection. The disorder also affects the gut and pancreas, so that food is not digested efficiently.The genetic information in an organism is called its genome. The Human Genome Project, or HGP for short, was started at the end of the last century. It was very ambitious and had several aims, including:to work out the order or sequence of all the three billionThe pairs of nitrogenous bases that connect the complementary strands of DNA.The basic units of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production.The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.The sequencing project was finished in 2001, and work continues to identify all the genes in the human genome. The HGP used the DNA of several people to get a sort of average sequence, but each person has a unique sequence (unless they have an identical twin).from 2006 about how scientists are unlocking the DNA code of extinct mammoths.Information about a person's DNA can be useful for. Genetic fingerprinting was invented in 1985 by Sir Alec Jeffreys at the University of Leicester. It uses some of the small differences between the DNA from different people to make a picture rather like a barcode. If enough parts of the DNA are tested, it is very unlikely that two identical DNA fingerprints would belong to two different people. This makes the method very useful for matching samples found at the scene of a crime to people suspected of committing the crime.It is hoped that information from the Human Genome Project will allow scientists to develop new ways of treating or diagnosing illnesses, especially genetic disorders and cancer.A person with cystic fibrosis has inherited two faulty alleles for a certain gene on one of their chromosomes, chromosome 7. It is hoped that it may one day be possible to repair the faulty alleles using, perhaps by putting the normal allele into the cells of the lungs. This would greatly improve the lives of people with cystic fibrosis, who often need lung transplants as their illness progresses.Members of some families are particularly at risk of developing certain types of breast cancer, because they carry faulty alleles. These alleles have been identified, and it is now possible to test people to see if they have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. This allows them to make decisions, if they wish, about whether to have surgery to remove breast tissue before any cancer develops in their breasts.

2	"Mount Etna blew its top last summer. The volcano blasted molten lava nearly 1 mile into the sky., scientists who study volcanoes, rushed to the mountain. Mount Etna is on Sicily, an island that is a part of Italy.The scientists went to Sicily to learn from the 3,000-year old volcano. One of the things they wanted to learn is how to predict when a volcano will erupt.Dozens of vulcanologists bravely climbed Mount Etna each day. They hoped that the mountain of fire would be a good teacher. ""We will probably learn more about this volcano during this eruption than had been learned in 3,000 years"", said Borris Behnke, a German scientist.Climbing Mount Etna is more dangerous than climbing some other volcanoes. The scientists risked being burned by the rivers of lava flowing down the volcano. Hot lava flowed from both the top of the volcano and from many, or holes, along the volcano's sides.Etna was also hurling huge rocks into the air. ""Some of them are bigger than cars and some might be as big as trucks,"" said Behnke.Some of the scientists didn't need to climb Mount Etna. Over the past few years, scientists had placed hundreds of sensors on the volcano. The sensors gather data about the lava flow and send the data by radio to scientists located a safe distance from the volcano.The sensors also record earthquakes. Earthquakes in a volcanic area can mean that the volcano is about to erupt. In the days before Mount Etna erupted, the sensors had picked up more than 2,600 small earthquakes.Behnke says that lava may erupt from Mount Etna for at least six more months. During that time, he plans to climb the volcano many times, risking his life to learn firsthand what is happening.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

They say ocean life is being wiped out by pollution and too much fishing.The loss of ocean life will mean less food. It will also affect the balance of the ocean’s ecosystem, say the scientists. An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals and the environment working as a unit to live.The study’s lead author, Boris Worm, says that it’s not too late to reverse the problem.

The uses we make of metals, which means they can be beaten or pressed into thin sheets.Compare the melting and boiling points of the metals and non-metals in this table:Melting and boiling points of metals and non-metalsThe uses we make of metals are related to their properties:, which is mostly iron, because it is a very strong material that is easy to press into the required shape.because it is a very good conductor of electricity.The filament of a light bulb is made frombecause this metal does not melt at the very high temperature needed to make it white hot.Metals have their characteristic properties because of their giant structure. In a metal crystal, the atoms are in a regular arrangement and strongly bonded together. Strong metallic bonding makes metals hard, but allows layers of atoms to slide so that the metal is malleable. The layers of atoms also allow an electric current to pass through.The extensive use of metals is having an effect on our environment:of metal ores creates large areas of barren and lifeless land.from metal extraction is left in spoil tips that scar the landscape.While some used metals are recycled, many metal articles are simplyToxic metal compounds leach out of waste material toRead on if you are taking theWe can explain the properties of metals by taking a more detailed look at their structure. Metal crystals are made up of positive metal ions surrounded by a sea of negative electrons.between positive ions and negative electrons means that a lot ofis needed to separate these particles from the crystal lattice. This means that metals are strong and have high melting and boiling points.Much less energy is needed to slide one layer of positive metal ions over another layer. This means that metals are easy to beat or press into shape.The sea of electrons in a metal crystal is mobile. If ais applied across a piece of metal, the electrons will move, carrying an electrical current. This means that metals are

2	History in the Making: Surviving the Great DepressionIn 1929, the U.S. stock market crashed. It marked the start of a period of hardship called the Great Depression. The U.S. economy suffered from low wages and reduced spending and production. Many people lost the money they had invested. During the 1930s, millions of people lost their jobs. Many families had trouble making a living. Abby interviewed her grandmother, Edith Russell, about this period.What hardships did the Great Depression cause you and your family?Things became scarce and unavailable. We had to go without things and work harder.Did your dad have a job during the Depression?My father farmed his own land. Farming was not very profitable during this time. [However,] those who worked outside of farming probably only earned $1 a day.Yes, we always had enough to eat. We always grew a huge garden with plenty of vegetables. We canned our own food; made bread, butter, and baked goods; and butchered meat.How old were you then? What was it like to go to school?I was around 8 years old. I really enjoyed going to school. I attended a one-room schoolhouse in the country. The big downfall was that I had to walk 3 miles to and from school.When the banks failed in 1929, did your family have money in them? If so, did your family lose all of its savings?No, we didn't have much money in the bank. My father wasn't [trustful] of banks and kept most of his money hidden right at home. However, the little he had in the bank was lost.Did you have enough money to buy clothes and shoes?I got a new pair of shoes once in a while for the winter, but in the summer I would go barefoot. Mama sewed most of my clothes. I only had about three different outfits.What did you and your family do for entertainment during these years?Our main entertainment was having the neighbors over to play ball. Once in a while, we got to listen to the radio.What effect did the Great Depression have on the way you live your life today?I always think back to those days and greatly appreciate everything I have today.This interview made me realize how terrible life during the Great Depression must have been. It helped me[or picture] those horrible years because it came from the heart of someone who is so dear to me.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

What light through yonder window breaks?It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,Who is already sick and pale with griefThat thou her maid art far more fair than she.Be not her maid, since she is envious:Her vestal livery is but sick and green,And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.– It is my lady! – O, it is my love!She speaks – yet she says nothing. What of that?Her eye discourses. I will answer it.– I am too bold. ‘Tis not to me she speaks.Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,Having some business, do entreat her eyesTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.What if her eyes were there, they in her head?The brightness of her cheek would shame those starsAs daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heavenWould through the airy region stream so brightThat birds would sing and think it were not night!See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.O that I were a glove upon that hand,O speak again, bright angel! – For thou artAs glorious to this night, being o’er my head,As is a wingèd messenger of heavenOf mortals that fall back to gaze on himAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?Deny thy father and refuse thy name –Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my loveAnd I’ll no longer be a Capulet.(Aside)Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?‘Tis but thy name that is my enemy.Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.What’s ‘Montague’?

Look thou but sweetAnd I am proof against their enmity.I would not for the world they saw thee here.I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes.And but thou love me, let them find me here.My life were better ended by their hateThan death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.By whose direction found’st thou out this place?By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.I am no pilot, yet wert thou as farAs that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheekFor that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.Fain would I dwell on form – fain, fain denyWhat I have spoke. – But farewell compliment!Dost thou love me?

O gentle Romeo,If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.Or if thou think I am too quickly won,I’ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,So thou wilt woo – but else, not for the world.In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light.But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more trueThan those that have more cunning to be strange.I should have been more strange, I must confess,But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ware,And not impute this yielding to light love,Which the dark night hath so discoverèd.Lady, by yonder blessèd moon I vow,That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops –O swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant moon,That monthly changes in her circled orb,Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,Which is the god of my idolatry,Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,I have no joy of this contract tonight.It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden –Too like the lightning, which doth cease to beEre one can say ‘It lightens’.

3	"> Writer's tricks - Persuading the readerSome persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate £20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.How does Charlotte Brontë try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.Use your knowledge to help Spherox find his way home.More than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

4	Evidence for the Big Bang - higherThere are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. Theses areYou may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretationThe light from other galaxies is red-shifted.The other galaxies are moving away from us.The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.For an activity that is out of this world!The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

4	Pigments are coloured substances used in paint. Paints are a type of mixture called a colloid. They contain several components, including the pigment, a solvent and a binding medium.Thermochromic and phosphorescent pigments are very useful, and extend the normal properties of paints.Dyes are substances that can be used to colour fabrics. In the past, people usually used natural dyes from animals and plants. For example,was extracted from sea snails, and redNowadays, most dyes are synthetic. The first synthetic dye,, was discovered by William Perkin accidentally in 1856, when he was just 18. Since then, many synthetic dyes have been made. They offer a large range of colours for dyeing fabrics, and they do not fade or wash out as easily as natural dyes.A molecular model of mauvine, a purple dyePaints are used to decorate surfaces or protect them from damage. Ais a coloured substance used in paint.a pigment - gives the paint its coloura binding medium – a liquid polymer that hardens to form a continuous layer when the paint driesa solvent - dissolves the binding medium and makes the paint more fluidOil paints have a hydrocarbon oil as the binding medium. This is dissolved in a solvent. The pigment is dispersed within this solution.When the paint dries the solvent evaporates away, leaving behind the pigment and oil binding medium. The oil hardens to form a continuous layer of dry paint.Emulsion paints are water-based - their solvent is water.Paints are a type of mixture called a. In a colloid, particles of one substance are mixed and dispersed with particles of another substance - but they are not dissolved in it.In an paint the pigment is dispersed in the liquid formed from the binding medium and solvent solution.pigments are sensitive to temperature. They change colour when they are heated up or cooled down. This property is useful for indicating if the drink in a cup is hot, or if the water in a kettle is hot.pigments glow in the dark. They are able to absorb light energy and store it. This stored energy is released as light energy over a period of time.Phosphorescent pigments are useful for watch faces that glow in the dark. They may also be used in fire safety signs placed near fire extinguishers. In the event of a fire, the position of the fire extinguishers can be seen, even if the lights fail.The components of a colloid are dispersed throughout the mixture. They do not separate out because their particles are small enough not to settle at the bottom.to form a hard film. This happens as the solvent evaporates and the oil reacts with oxygen in the air.In the past, glow-in-the-dark watch faces used radioactive paints. Phosphorescent pigments are much safer, though.

Brianna liked to download TV theme songs and music by Mariah Carey from the Internet onto her computer.However, record companies said that by sharing music files online, Brianna was stealing. As a result, she was one of 261 people sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in early September. Brianna was targeted because she had swapped more than 1,000 songs online.Approximately 60 million people download music files from the Internet. In most cases, that is against the law. The music industry has compared it with shoplifting, saying most people wouldn't steal CDs from a store.There are laws that exist to protect the rights of musicians. The laws say it is illegal to copy songs without permission from musicians and record companies.During the past three years, CD sales have fallen. The recording industry says it loses billions of dollars each year when people, or steal, songs. The music industry is hoping the lawsuits will scare people away from swapping songs online.The lawsuits have left many people stunned. Some are concerned that innocent people might be wrongly accused when their children or grandchildren download music. One 71-year-old grandfather from Texas is being sued. He didn't know that his grandchildren had copied music onto his computer.Some people have said they didn't know they were breaking the law. Others think the record companies are bullies picking on ordinary people.Brianna's mother didn't take any chances. Agreeing to pay $2,000, she became the first of the 261 people to settle the lawsuit and to avoid having to go to court. ""I am sorry for what I have done,"" said Brianna. ""I love music and don't want to hurt the artists I love.""People Say That Sharing Music Files Is...45% - all right, with a few friendsMany people don't like paying high prices for music CDs. They say they like to get their music online because it's easy-and it's free.During the past three years, music sales have suffered a huge loss. Record industry officials blame the drop on the increasing number of people who get their songs free on the Internet.To draw music fans back into stores, the world's largest record company announced a few weeks ago that it would lower its CD prices. Universal Music Group said its CDs would sell in stores for about $12.98 instead of the current prices ranging from $16.98 to $18.98.For people who still want to get their music online, they can do it without breaking the law. Some music-sharing services on the Web work in a similar way to record stores. The services charge a small fee for each song that is copied.Do you think fear of being punished will stop people from swapping music online?

This meant their status was low for a long time, although their skills were valued by many people.Pliny was a writer and naturalist of ancient RomeAfter the conquest of Greece in 47BC, most doctors in Rome were, brought to Rome as slaves. Yet, whilst they flocked to see these doctors, the Romans were also suspicious of them.Pliny, the ancient Roman writer and naturalist, represented them as, who tried out their too-clever theories at the cost of their patients' lives., who came from Pergamum and had been trained at Alexandria. Galen learned his trade at a school of gladiators.The Romans neglected to develop further the Greeks' ideas about the nature of disease, and in some ways medicine regressed under their rule. However, Roman doctors did develop ideas ofas causes of disease, and these ideas were to have a great impact on the history of medicine., and they built on the Greeks' knowledge of anatomy and physiology (though not without errors).[Note how this passage disproves the point Pliny is trying to make.]I will not mention many famous doctors like Cassius, Calpetanus, Arruntius and Rubrius. Their annual salaries were a quarter of a million sesterces. When Nero was emperor, people rushed to Thessalus, who overturned all previous theories and when he walked about in public he was followed by as big a crowd as an actor or chariot-driver. Next came Crinas of Massilia, who decided what his patients could eat according to the astrologers' almanacs.There is no doubt that these doctors, in their hunt to gain fame by means of some new idea, did not hesitate to buy it with our lives. Consequently those wretched quarrelsome consultations at the bedside of patients. Consequently also the gloomy inscription on monuments: ""It was the crowd of doctors that killed me"".Medicine changes every day and we are swept along on the puffs of the clever brains of the Greeks. People can live without doctors (though not, of course, without medicine). It was not medicine which our ancestors hated, but doctors. They refused to pay fees to profiteers in order to save their lives. Of all the Greek arts, it is only medicine which we serious Romans have not yet practiced.What can Pliny tell historians about medicine in Roman times?Were doctors in Roman times hated or fêted?1. What can Pliny tell historians about medicine in Roman times?There were many famous doctors ('many famous doctors like Cassius, Calpetanus, Arruntius and Rubrius...')The doctors were well-paid ('Their annual salaries were a quarter of a million sesterces.')Greek doctors were treated as celebrities ('... and when he walked about in public he was followed by as big a crowd as an actor or chariot-driver.')Greek doctors in Rome developed new ideas ('Thessalus, who overturned all previous theories'Pliny disliked the Greek doctors ('People can live without doctors'.)Pliny felt that standards of professionalism were poor ('...those wretched quarrelsome consultations at the bedside of patients.')Roman doctors could not heal their patients ('It was the crowd of doctors that killed me.')Pliny distrusted medical theories ('we are swept along on the puffs of the clever brains of the Greeks.')Pliny resented paying fees ('our ancestors refused to pay fees to profiteers...')Pliny felt that medicine was not serious/practical ('...it is only medicine which we serious Romans have not yet practiced.')2. Were doctors in Roman times hated or fêted?Pliny obviously hated the doctors, but they were clearly mobbed by followers and patients and were paid huge salaries.""Roman medicine was dominated by ideas derived from the needs of the Army.""Think about the above sentence as you look back over the Roman section, and make a list of the points that support what it says.Another good revision idea would be to make a list of everything you can find out about the Roman doctorAs part of your revision, think about theRoman medicine reflected the ideas and practices of Roman civilisation.caused people to be healthy or unhealthy in Roman times.ideas the Romans had about the causes and treatment of illness and injuries.medicine changed in Roman times, and what he main turning points were.some diagnoses and treatments changed while others remained the same.the process of change was influenced by:developments in medical understanding and practice in Roman times affected people's lives."

On July 13, the fifth Harry Potter film,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,hits the big screen. This is just one week before the July 21 release ofthe seventh and final book in the hugely popular series written by J. K. Rowling. Actor Daniel Radcliffe returns in the role of Harry. Daniel talked toabout what the character means to him.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry is sick of being famous. How about you?I'm feeling pretty good. I don't think of myself as being famous. On the set, you're there to work. It's a very fun job to do, but it's a job, and you do it and that's that.Like Harry, you're getting older. How well does the character reflect your experience growing up?I think it's a very accurate portrayal in terms of Harry's confusion and fear of growing up, and the challenges he knows it's inevitable he will face. That's what Harry Potter is about for me. It's not magic. It's not good versus evil. It's about a loss of innocence, going from a little kid to a young man.Speaking of good versus evil, fans begin to learn more about Harry's least favorite teacher, Severus Snape, with the forming of the Order of the Phoenix. Whose side do you think Snape is on?That is the ultimate question. [What] if I go out and say deep down, he's a really decent chap, [and he turns out to be bad]?

Scientists have opened a tomb in Spain that they believe contains his bones. The bones are traveling to a laboratory in Spain for testing.Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.
2	"People often take trips on our nation's roads and highways. But recently, several sections of an old road went on a trip of their own.Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses.The road became so popular that it inspired a 1960s TV show,, as well as a famous song, ""Get Your Kicks on Route 66.""In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going.Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

Give yourself plenty of practice beforehand by thinking about how you might express illness, etc. and what language you would need in order to explain how you feel to someone else.Look through past papers and you will see that the same kind of phrases come up frequently. Begin by learning these basic phrases off by heart so that you will be well equipped to make a good attempt at answering any question on health, illness, etc.Use the warm-up exercises to help you brush up on the phrases which come up often in role plays about health.Remember also to revise and learn by heart the vocabulary which you need for health - especially the various emotions, parts of the body and illnesses which appear very often in these situations.In the role-plays it is very important to say something for every part of each question in order to score the full marks. For example, if you are asked to say 'a glass of water' and you only say 'water' you will not be awarded the maximum number of marks. During your preparation time, take particular care with this so that nothing gets left out when you deliver your answer.
2	"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

4	Regular exercise and a balanced diet are needed to keep the body healthy. Too little food leads to a person being underweight and prone to illness, while too much food and not enough exercise leads to a person being overweight and prone to other illnesses. Excess cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease, and excess salt causes high blood pressure and increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.A mixture of different types of food in the correct amounts is needed to maintain health. The main food groups are:potatoes, pasta, bread, bananas, sugar and ricefor other life processes. Sometimes referred to as, which is actually just one - very common - type of carbohydrate.Fats are needed to make cell membranes and toour bodies. They also contain important fat-solubleorganic substances which are essential in small amounts to regulate the metabolism and maintain the immune systemThe fibre or roughage in our diet is not digested, but is important because it allows the muscles in our intestines to move food through our system bywave-like muscular contractions in the smooth wall of the gut which move food through the alimentary canalA healthy diet contains all the different nutrients in the correct amounts, and provides the right amount of energy for each individual. An unbalanced diet can lead to a person becoming malnourished. They may be too thin or too fat as a result, and they may suffer from deficiency diseases.Respiration is the chemical reaction that allows cells to release energy from food. The metabolic rate is the speed at which such chemical reactions take place in the body. It varies because of several factors, including:the proportion of muscle to fat in the bodythe amount of exercise and other physical activityThe metabolic rate increases as we exercise and stays high for a while afterwards.If you don't eat enough food, you will become too thin and may suffer from health problems. These include:- which affects proper growth of the skeleton and is caused by insufficient vitamin D - and- which causes a swollen abdomen and is a result of insufficient protein.Problems such as these are more likely to affect people in the developing world, where it can be more difficult to get enough food.In warm weather, or when you don't do much exercise, you do not need to eat as much food as when it is cold or when you have exerted yourself physically. If you eat too much food without taking enough exercise, you will become overweight. Very fat people are described as. Overweight people may suffer from health problems, including:- an illness in which the body is unable to control the amount of sugar in the blood- an illness in which the joints become worn, inflamed and painfulThe heart is an organ that needs its own supply of blood to keep it working. If the blood supply is reduced, the heart muscle will not work properly and will become weaker. A heart attack happens when part of the heart does not get any blood because of a blocked artery.In order to see this content you need to have bothCholesterol is a substance found in the blood. It is made in the liver and is needed for healthy cell membranes. However, too much cholesterol in the blood increases the risk of heart disease, and of diseased arteries.The bloodstream transports cholesterol around the body attached toorganic compounds made up of amino acid molecules. One of the three main food groups, proteins are needed by the body for cell growth and repair.. The combination of cholesterol and protein is called- LDLs - carry cholesterol from the liver to the cells.- HDLs - carry excess cholesterol back to the liver.LDLs are often called 'bad' cholesterol because they lead to fat building up on artery walls, which causes heart disease. HDLs are often called ‘good’ cholesterol because they help to stop fat building up in the arteries.from 2006 about ‘statins’, a family of drugs that can improve high blood pressure and cholesterol levels.A high proportion of HDLs to LDLs is good for a healthy heart. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated oils - as found in vegetable oils - help to reduce cholesterol levels in the blood, and also increase the proportion of HDLs compared with LDLs. Check your understanding of such oils by looking atThere are also drugs that can improve high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels.Table salt is sodium chloride. Too much salt in the diet can lead to, which in turn leads to an increased risk of heart disease and strokes.found naturally in many kinds of food, but more is added by food manufacturers - and many people add even more when they are eating. Processed foods often have a high proportion of salt and fat. Salt added to food during processing accounts for about two-thirds of the average salt intake.On average, men in the UK eat about 10g of salt a day and women about 8g a day. However, food scientists recommend no more thanin the diet. Reducing the amount of salt in the diet will help to reduce the risk of heart disease, and to a greater extent the risk of suffering a stroke.from 2006 about the governments salt guidelines.There is some evidence that the food industry has persuaded government bodies to set higher targets for the recommended amount of dietary salt in our food than doctors might wish.

That is equal to seven times the speed of sound. The aircraft made a 10-second powered flight and then glided for six minutes before plunging into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.Before taking off on its own, the jet launched from the wing of a plane in midair.A rocket, which was later released, helped boost the jet's speed.""Everything worked according to plan. It's been wonderful,"" said NASA's Leslie Williams. ""We've been waiting a few years.""NASA attempted to fly a similar unmanned jet three years earlier. However, a failure in the launch system caused the flight to explode.In 1947, American pilot Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly atspeed, or faster than the speed of sound. NASA hopes its record-breaking feat will lead to a new era of supersonic flight for military, business, and space ventures.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

2	"The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings.Queen Nefertiti's name means ""the beautiful one has come."" It is not surprising that she was given such a name. Queen Nefertiti has long been admired for her swanlike neck and high cheekbones.But Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face. She is believed to have been one of the most powerful women who ever lived. She ruled Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Egypt is a country in Africa.Mysteriously, no one knows how Queen Nefertiti died. Her remains have never been found--until now, perhaps.led by Joann Fletcher uncovered three mummies in a tomb in Egypt. (Archaeologists are scientists who dig up ancient objects and study them to learn about the past.) Fletcher believes that one of the mummies is Queen Nefertiti.Modern science is helping Fletcher prove her idea and identify the face of the mummy. After X-rays of the mummy were taken, scientists put together a computerized version of what the face would have looked like.What they discovered was amazing! The re-created face resembles a famous sculpture of Queen Nefertiti that was made during her reign.""If the mummy is who we think it is, it would certainly help to answer a lot of unanswered questions,"" said Fletcher.Scientists are quick to point out that the computerized version of the face does not prove that the mummy is Queen Nefertiti. The re-created face, however, isn't the only clue to the past.There are other pieces of the puzzle that make Fletcher's team think the mummy is Nefertiti. First, the mummy's hair had been shaved off. Nefertiti preferred a shaved head so that her crown would fit tightly. A shaved head also helped her stay cool in Egypt's heat. Second, traces of a wig found next to the mummy matched the kind Nefertiti would have worn.In addition, the mummy's left earlobe was pierced twice. Statues of Nefertiti show her having a double-pierced ear. The mummy's forehead showed the mark of a tight-fitting band--a sign of royalty. Another clue was the mummy's bent arm, which was broken off. Royalty were usually buried with their arms bent.Not all scientists are convinced that the mummy is Nefertiti.""If the mummy is female and if it is royal, then you still do not necessarily have Nefertiti,"" one archaeologist toldAnother scientist from Egypt expressed doubts that the mummy is even a female. He said that both men and women could have double-pierced ears.But Fletcher believes that she has found the long-lost queen and has returned Nefertiti to her rightful place in history.The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. That is an ancient burial ground for royalty. It is located in the desert, south of Cairo (the capital of Egypt) and along the west bank of the Nile River.Scientists are starting to piece together more about the legendary queen's life. Nefertiti is now one of the most popular faces from ancient history, but that wasn't always the case., ruled Egypt together and had many enemies. Pharaoh is a name given to Egyptian kings.The pharaoh and Nefertiti were disliked because they challenged the religion of the time. They began to worship one god instead of many gods. As part of their new religion, they moved from the city of Thebes and built a new capital in the heart of the desert. The new capital was called Akhetaton (ah-keh-TAHT-uhn).(The modern name is Amarna.) They also made many changes to the style of art and architecture of the time.Many historians think that when Nefertiti's husband died, she became pharaoh.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
2	"Most schoolchildren in the United States can say the words to the Pledge of Allegiance by heart. But the pledge is now in the middle of a debate. At the center of the debate is whether it is right for students to say the pledge in public schools.Last summer, a federal court in California ruled that the pledge isin public school classrooms. A law is considered unconstitutional if a court decides that it goes against the U.S. Constitution. The court ruled that the pledge is unconstitutional because it includes the phrase ""under God.""The court says that the phrase suggests that the government, or supports, religion. That would violate the First Amendment to the Constitution. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and prevents the government from establishing an official religion for the nation.The recent court ruling has angered many people across the country. They see the pledge as a way to express their, or loyalty, to the United States.Nine western states are part of the court's ruling. Students in those states were ordered to stop saying the pledge. Those states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington.However, the ruling has been temporarily put on hold. The Elk Grove School District in California, where the case began, has asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review and overturn the lower court's ruling.Do you think saying the pledge violates the First Amendment? Discuss in class. Then let us know in the Write On section ofElk Grove Superintendent Dave Gordon said, ""We feel strongly that the words 'under God' do not push religion on children, but reflect this country's history.""All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

The wild cats are on the brink ofDuring the early 1900s, hundreds of the large, light-brown cats roamed the southeastern United States. Today, panthers can be found only in southern Florida. Wildlife officials estimate that only between 80 and 100 panthers are left in the Sunshine State.What is causing the sharp decline in the panther population? Hunting and habitat loss are mainly to blame. During the mid- to late 1900s, millions of people flocked to Florida for its warm climate and inexpensive land. As people built homes and roads, panthers were squeezed out of their habitat.In 1967, Florida panthers were placed on the endangered species list in the United States. The list was created to protect animals that are on the edge of extinction.Today, wildlife officials are working to keep the wild cats out of, or danger. Workers have installed fencing along 40 miles of public roads in south-western Florida to prevent panthers from colliding with cars and other vehicles.Officials are also making efforts to save the land where panthers live from further development. ""We have to protect what's left of their habitat,"" panther expert Bob DeGross toldA panther is about 10 times as large as a house cat. Adult males can weigh up to 150 pounds; females typically weigh about 70 pounds.Panthers are skilled hunters. They mainly prey on white-tailed deer and wild hogs but will also eat armadillos, raccoons, and even alligators.Panthers became Florida's official state animal in 1982.Baby panthers stay with their mothers for about two years, learning to hunt and survive.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

There was plenty ofamong the first people on the land, fostered by a range of customs and rituals.The Native Americans were not one people, but many. The most famous tribes were the Apache, Sioux, Blackfeet and Cheyenne, each one led by its own Council of Elders.The Native American way of government led new settlers on the Great Plains to think that the earliest inhabitants of the land had no government at all. This was not true, but their government was based on principles that the newcomers had difficulty in understanding.A Comanche tipi village by George CatlinFor example, a Native American chief hadover his people, although he did have greatfrom them, based on his bravery in war. And the only 'police' in Native American society were warriors called, who selected and broke camp, fed the old and the weak, stopped buffalo being scared away, and controlled the hunt.In fact, the hunt was the only occasion when everybody had to obey. The Native American tribes did not need strict laws, because the harsh environment forced them to work together. Consequently, most tribes had, and the worst punishment was banishment (which meant death, given the harsh Plains environment).

2	"Construction workers in Rome, Italy, recently dug up the ruins of an ancient poet's house. While digging a trash dump, the workers discovered the house that belonged to Ovid, a poet who lived about 2,000 years ago., located on the banks of the Tiber River. Many of his poems and letters are about his villa. Just as Ovid was becoming a great poet, he offended the emperor of Rome and was forced to leave his beloved villa for a distant city. While he was away, he wrote nostalgic letters about his home.Scientists are amazed by the discovery. ""By itself, the villa is a notable finding, but it acquires even more value because it is the place where one of the greatest poets in Rome lived,"" explained Gaetano Messineo, one of the scientists at the dig.City officials in Rome plan to put up a building around Ovid's ancient villa to protect it. But the area will not look as it did in Ovid's time.

Next came Crinas of Massilia, who decided what his patients could eat according to the astrologers' almanacs.There is no doubt that these doctors, in their hunt to gain fame by means of some new idea, did not hesitate to buy it with our lives.

4	The novel is about three years in the life of the Finch family: Atticus and his son Jem and daughter Scout. Atticus is a lawyer and the central incident of the novel is when he defends a black man, Tom Robinson, against the charge of raping a white girl.The 'I' or 'we' used by a narrator who is a participant in a narrative, in contrast to the third person 'he', 'she' or 'they' of a narrator who is not directly involved.by Scout Finch, a young girl - so we see things from her point of view, and sometimes we need to reinterpret what she tells us.Jem (aged 10) and Scout (aged 6) meet Dill (aged 7), who has come to stay with his aunt in Maycomb during the summer vacation. Dill becomes interested in 'Boo' Radley, a recluse who lives next door to the Finches and whom they have never seen. AA traditional story which is more or less universally shared within a community; an idea which is widely held but not true.has grown up locally about Boo and the children are scared of him. It is Dill's idea to make Boo come out.After that vacation, Scout starts school. Since she can already read and write, yet is told she is doing them wrongly by her inexperienced young teacher, she takes an immediate dislike to school. She gets into trouble when she tries to explain to her teacher why Walter Cunningham, from a very poor family, cannot borrow money for lunch as he will not be able to pay it back. Jem invites Walter to lunch with them.Jem and Scout find gifts, apparently left for them, in the knothole of a tree on the edge of the Radleys' property.The following summer, Dill returns for the vacation. Jem accidentally pushes Scout in an old car tyre right into the Radleys' yard, which terrifies her. The three children act out spooky stories about Boo and Jem tries to deliver a note to Boo on the end of a fishing pole. Atticus stops them and tries to make them more considerate by thinking of things from another person's point of view.However, on the last day of the holidays, the three sneak onto the Radleys' property at night. Nathen, Boo's older brother, shoots at them; as they make their escape, Jem loses his trousers. When he goes back for them, he finds them neatly mended and hung over the fence, as if waiting for him.That autumn, Scout and Jem find more presents in the knothole, including a watch, a spelling medal and two figures of the children carved from soap. They realise the gifts must be from Boo. Just when they are about to deliver a note of thanks, Nathan cements the hole up.One very cold night there is a fire at their neighbour's, Miss Maudie. As Jem and Scout stand shivering outside, someone puts a blanket over Scout. Jem is convinced that Boo did it and tells Atticus about the presents and his mended trousers.Atticus takes on the defence of Tom Robinson, a Negro. Scout is taunted about this by various children, including her cousin Francis at a family Christmas gathering - he calls Atticus a 'nigger lover'. Jem and Scout's admiration for their father rises enormously, though, when he shoots a dangerous mad dog with one shot.When old Mrs Dubose also insults the children because of Atticus' involvement in Tom Robinson's case, Jem is so furious that he beheads every camellia in her yard. As a punishment, Jem has to read to her every night for a month. When she dies, Atticus explains to the children that she was a morphine addict who was trying to break the habit and succeeded just before her death ' rather than hate her they should admire her courage.While Atticus is away on business, Calpurnia - the Finches' Negro cook - takes Jem and Scout to the black church. The community there honour the children's presence out of gratitude for all that Atticus is doing for Tom.Aunt Alexandra - Atticus' sister - arrives to stay with the family, believing that Jem and Scout (particularly Scout!) need a mother figure. (Their own mother died when Scout was two.) There is a row when it is discovered that the children went to the black church and Aunt Alexandra forbids Scout from visiting Calpurnia's house.Dill arrives in the middle of the night, having run away from his new stepfather.Tom in jail while Atticus talks to the mobA deputation of local men tries to persuade Atticus not to take Tom's case, but he refuses. The night before his trial, Tom is brought to Maycomb jail and Atticus plans to sit outside during the night. Jem, Scout and Dill sneak out to check he is all right. A gang arrives to lynch Tom, but when the children burst into the ring of men and Scout, recognising one of the men as Mr Cunningham, asks him politely about Walter, the tension is diffused and the mob disperses.Tom's trial begins. The whole town is in the courthouse. The children sit in the black balcony with the Reverend Sykes. It becomes clear through the testimonies of Heck Tate, Mr Bob Ewell, Mayella Ewell and Tom Robinson, that Mr Ewell and Mayella are lying. Far from being raped by Tom Robinson, Mayella had actually led him on and when her father discovered her he had beaten her.Taking a break from the trial, Dill and Scout talk with Mr Raymond outside the courthouse. He lives happily with a black woman, yet he pretends to everyone that he is permanently drunk in order to escape the pressure from townspeople who could not believe that he chooses to live in such a way.Despite the overwhelming evidence that Tom is innocent, the all-white jury convicts him. All Negroes in the balcony stand as Atticus leaves the court, out of respect.Town gossip continues after the trial. Mr Ewell spits at Atticus: although he 'won', he knows that he has been badly shown up by Atticus and wants to get him back. Jem and Scout are anxious that Mr Ewell will harm their father, but Atticus reassures them.Jem has been badly shaken by the result of the trial and has difficulty in making sense of things.Aunt Alexandra presides over a Missionary Society tea. Scout has to be there, wearing a dress and acting like a lady. Atticus comes with the news that Tom Robinson has been shot dead by guards when trying to escape from prison and takes Calpurnia to help him break the news to Tom's widow.Bad news during Aunt Alexandra's tea partyBack at school, Scout learns about Hitler's treatment of the Jews and is amazed that no one in Maycomb seems able to connect that to the racism in the town.Mr Ewell tries to break into Judge Taylor's house and menaces Tom Robinson's widow.They are both attacked on Halloween nightJem and Scout attend a Halloween pageant at school - its subject is the history of Maycomb county and Scout is dressed as a shoulder of ham. She misses her entry on stage and so decides to keep her costume on to walk home in, to hide her embarrassment. It is a dark night and Jem soon realises they are being followed. They are both attacked - Scout is squashed inside her costume and Jem breaks his arm. Someone carries Jem home.The attacker was Mr Ewell: he is found dead, with a kitchen knife in his ribs.The person who rescued them - Boo RadleyWhile Jem is still unconscious after the attack, Scout tells her story. It dawns on her slowly that the person who rescued them - and who has stood shyly in the corner of the room throughout her explanation - is Boo Radley.Unusually for him, Atticus takes a while to realise exactly what had happened during the attack: he initially believed that Jem had stabbed Mr Ewell (and would therefore have to face the consequences), but Heck Tate knows it was Boo who killed him. They agree to put out the story that Mr Ewell died by falling on his own knife, to protect Boo.Scout leads Boo back home. She never sees him again. Yet, standing finally outside the window where Boo always sits, she puts herself in his shoes and understands what life must be like for him.Explore the 'To Kill a Mockingbird' timelineYour web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

Scientists recently discovered that male dragonflies use movement as a form ofMany animals use camouflage to blend into their surroundings. Some butterflies, for example, have patterns that let them hide among leaves and twigs. Most animals, however, can remain unseen only while they stay very still. That’s why this new dragonfly finding has many scientists puzzled.The dragonfly uses motion camouflage to fool its prey into thinking that it’s not moving and not a threat. The dragonfly’s prey include other insects it feeds on, such as mosquitoes and moths.Researchers say that the dragonfly carefully changes position again and again as it closes in on its target. The dragonfly appears, to the eye of its prey, to remain in the same place--but in fact it’s moving.

2	"Some call his journey remarkable. Others call it just plain crazy. For Christopher Swain, it was the swim of a lifetime.Swain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean.Why did he do it? ""Every waterway needs a champion,"" Swain told. ""I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up.""In 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon.The Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark's journey. Today, it is ravaged by, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river's salmon population.that have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms.The pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water.""The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty,"" Swain told. ""It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth.""Despite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean.""With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around,"" Swain said. ""Kids know that they want clean water.""Earlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn't finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston.How will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? ""I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day,"" he promised.Each year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment.This year, the Earth Day theme is ""Water for Life."" Here are some ways experts say that kids can help protect water:You can conserve water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth.Organize a beach or river cleanup. Beach garbage, such as plastic rings, can get tangled around sea creatures and injure or harm them.Make sure to put trash in its proper place-not in the water or down a drain.What does Swain mean when he refers to the river as a ""contaminated beauty""?measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

They are in danger of becomingor dying out completely. This list includes emperor penguins.""Many of the world's penguin species are in big trouble,"" penguin expert Kassie Siegel toldHer wildlife group is asking the U.S. government to protect the 12 threatened species of penguins.Overfishing is partly to blame for the problem. Penguins eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals calledFishing boats are catching large amounts of krill. That leaves less food for penguins to eat.Another reason for the decline in the number of penguins is global warming. Global warming is the slow increase in average temperature around the world. It is causing sea ice to melt. Penguins need the floating sea ice as a place to rest while they search for krill.Scientists say people contribute to global warming when they drive cars or use electricity.

This can be aerobic respiration, which needs oxygen, or anaerobic respiration, which does not. During exercise, the breathing rate and heart rate increase. During hard exercise an oxygen debt may build up.The blood in the arteries is under pressure because of the contractions of the heart muscles. This allows the blood to reach all parts of the body. You can see how the heart pumps the blood to the lungs and rest of the body by studying this animation:In order to see this content you need to have bothBlood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury,- the higher measurement when the heart beats, pushing blood through the arteries, and- the lower measurement when the heart rests between beatsA young, fit person may have a blood pressure of about 120 over 70, which means their systolic pressure is 120 mmHg, and their diastolic pressure 70 mmHg.Blood pressure varies with age. It also varies with lifestyle factors such as:Respiration is the process by which energy is released from glucose.Aerobic respiration requires oxygen. It happens in cells when glucose reacts with oxygen. Here are the word and symbol - higher only - equations:glucose + oxygen    →    carbon dioxide + water (+ energy)Energy is shown in brackets in each equation because it is not a chemical substance.Anaerobic respiration does not need oxygen. It happens when there is not enough oxygen for aerobic respiration. Here is the word equation:glucose    →    lactic acid (+ energy)Much less energy is released by anaerobic respiration than by aerobic respiration.During exercise, the muscle cells respire more than they do at rest. This means:oxygen and glucose must be delivered to them more quicklywaste carbon dioxide must be removed more quicklyThis is achieved by increasing the breathing rate and heart rate. The increase in heart rate can be detected by measuring theDuring hard exercise, the oxygen supply may not be enough for the needs of the muscle cells. When this happens, anaerobic respiration takes place, as well as aerobic respiration. The lactic acid that forms causes muscle fatigue and pain.Fit people are able to carry out physical activities more effectively than unfit people. Theiris likely to return to normal more quickly after exercise.But being fit is not the same as being healthy. Healthy people are free from disease and infection: they may or may not be fit as well. It is possible to be fit but unhealthy, or healthy but unfit.Extremes of blood pressure can create problems.During hard exercise when anaerobic respiration occurs with aerobic respiration, anbuilds up. This is because glucose is not broken down completely to form carbon dioxide and water. Some of it is broken down to form lactic acid. Panting after exercise provides oxygen to breakdown lactic acid. The increased heart rate also allows lactic acid to be carried away by the blood to the liver, where it is broken down.

When he was 6, he learned about the shortage of safe drinking water in some parts of the world. Today, Ryan’s Well Foundation has raised more than $1.5 million to build more than 200 wells in 11 countries, most in Africa.During his mission to raise money, Ryan became pen pals with Akana Jimmy, an orphan who lived in Africa. In Jimmy’s tiny village of Agweo, Uganda, there was no clean water until Ryan raised enough money to buy the village its first well. A new book tells the story of their life-changing friendship—Ryan and Jimmy and the Well in Africa That Brought Them Together.Jimmy used to wake up before midnight and walk 3 miles to the nearest pond. There, he would fill a large plastic container withor polluted, water. Jimmy made that trip three times every day before heading to school. ""Because you don’t have any choice, you drink it,"" he toldIn 1998, Ryan’s first-grade teacher told the class that polluted water was causing thousands of children to become sick and even die. For Ryan, a lack of clean water was unimaginable. His teacher said the cost of building a well in Africa was just $70. Determined to help, Ryan spent months doing household chores to earn enough money to pay for a well.Later that year, Ryan proudly took his savings to WaterCan, a Canadian organization that helps provide safe drinking water to impoverished countries. To his disappointment, Ryan was told that the cost of building a well was much higher: $2,000.or promised, to continue raising money. Word of his mission spread, and soon the media picked up his story. To Ryan’s astonishment, people started sending him donations. By 2000, Ryan, then 9, had raised enough money to build his first well. With help from Canadian Physicians for Aid and Relief, Ryan chose Jimmy’s village as the site for the well.Ryan’s well changed the lives of the people in Agweo and especially affected Jimmy’s life. That’s when the two boys became pen pals. They became friends when Ryan traveled to Uganda in 2000 to help complete the well.In 2003, Ryan’s family arranged to bring Jimmy to their home in Canada.

4	Electricity is supplied to consumers through the National Grid at a very high voltage to reduce energy losses during transmission. Transformers are used to increase or decrease the voltage of the supply. Electricity is charged in units. One unit is equivalent to one kilowatt of electricity used for one hour.Power stations are built in order to generate electricity. The diagram shows the main steps involved.the fuel is burned to boil water to make steamthe spinning turbine turns a generator which produces electricitythe electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltageThe energy needed to boil the water comes from fossil fuels or nuclear fuels. Renewable energy resources such as wind and wave power may drive the generators directly.A transformer is an electrical device that changes the voltage of an alternating current (ac) supply, such as the mains electrical supply. A transformer changes a high-voltage supply into a low-voltage one, or vice versa.A transformer that increases the voltage is calledA transformer that decreases the voltage is calledElectricity is transferred from power stations to consumers through the wires and cables of the National Grid. When a current flows through a wire some energy is lost as heat. The higher the current, the more heat is lost. To reduce these losses,the National Grid transmits electricity at a low currentPower stations produce electricity at 25,000V. Electricity is sent through the National Grid cables at 400,000V, 275,000V and 132,000V.Step-up transformers are used at power stations to produce the very high voltages needed to transmit electricity through the National Grid power lines. These high voltages are too dangerous to use in the home, so step-down transformers are used locally to reduce the voltage to safe levels. The voltage of household electricity is about 230V.Fed up of reading?

4	You should be able to describe how heat energy is lost from buildings and to explain how these losses can be reduced.Take a look at this image showing heat loss from a house.red shows where most heat is lost - through the windows and roofHeat energy is transferred from homes byThe transfer of heat energy through a material - without the material itself moving.through the walls, floor, roof and windows. It is also transferred from homes byThe transfer of heat energy through a moving liquid or gas.. For example, cold air can enter the house through gaps in doors and windows, and convection currents can transfer heat energy in the loft to the roof tiles. Heat energy also leaves the house by radiation through the walls, roof and windows.There are some simple ways to reduce heat loss, including fitting carpets, curtains and draught excluders.Heat loss through windows can be reduced using double glazing. The gap between the two panes of glass is filled with air. Heat loss through conduction is reduced, as air is a poor conductor of heat. Heat transfer by convection currents is also reduced by making the gap is very narrow.You may wish to view this BBC News item from 2006 about energy efficiency in homes.Heat loss through walls can be reduced using cavity wall insulation. This involves blowing insulating material into the gap between the brick and the inside wall, which reduces the heat loss by conduction. The material also prevents air circulating inside the cavity, therefore reducing heat loss by convection.Heat loss through the roof can be reduced by laying loft insulation. This works in a similar way to cavity wall insulation.Fed up of reading?

4	Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.Here is an example of a food chain. Grass is eaten by voles that are eaten by owls.A food chain shows how energy isfrom one organism to another. The original source of energy is the Sun, which in this example provides thein this food chain. The vole and the owl areof organisms in a food chain can be represented graphically in a. Each bar represents the number of individuals at each trophic level (feeding level) in the food chain.In this example a large number of caterpillars living in a single oak tree provide food for several blue tits, which in turn are consumed by a sparrowhawk.The pyramid of numbers usually shows that the number of organisms at each trophic level gets smaller towards the top. This particular case is an exception – one tree provides food for many caterpillars.of plants to provide sufficient energy for theis a more accurate indication of how muchis passed on at each trophic level.in each organism multiplied by the total number of organisms in that trophic level. This makes it easier to compare the food value of a small number of large organisms with a large number of small organisms. Pyramids of biomass usually are a true pyramid shape (each level is smaller than the one below it).The biomass in each trophic level is always less than the trophic level below. This is because biomass is a measure of the amount of food available. When animals eat, only a small proportion of their food is converted into new tissue, which is the food for the next trophic level. Most of the biomass that animals eat is either not digested, or used to provide the energy needed for staying alive.This table shows that for each 100kJ of energy consumed by a cow, 63kJ is not absorbed into the cow and only 4kJ is converted into new tissue.How much energy is used in respiration and given out as heat?Total energy 100kJ = 4kJ + 63kJ + energy used in respiration.So energy used in respiration = 100 - 67 =How efficient is energy transfer to the next level of the food chain?The cow is 4% efficient at converting its food into food for the next trophic level.Efficiency of energy transfer = (energy transferred to next level x 100) / energy from previous levelEfficiency of energy transfer = (4kJ x 100) / 100kJenergy converter it could be given food that's easier to digest, to reduce the energy lost by egestion. It could also be kept in conditions where it doesn't need to use as much energy in respiration – it could be kept warm, and prevented from moving around. These ideas are used in intensive farming techniques.the amount of energy available to the next trophic level by about 90%. This means that the top trophic levels receive very little energy unless they live in very fertile habitats. For this reason there's a limit to the number of trophic levels in a food chain.Try the next animation to see how much energy is available to the top trophic level. Work out the efficiency of energy transfer at each trophic level. Note the units of energy used are kilocalories. One kilocalorie is equivalent to 4.2 kilojoules.

2	"Five California condors died last summer in Arizona's arid backcountry.A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets., which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, toldthat saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

Scientists have recently reported that the number of sharks in the North Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico has declined by half in the past 15 years., or kinds, of sharks live in the waters around the world. The researchers found that populations of some of the best-known sharks, including hammerheads and great whites, have been affected. The hammerhead suffered the steepest drop-an 89 percent decrease. The number of great white sharks declined by 79 percent.According to scientists, the dramatic drop in shark populations is due to overfishing. The shark population is also threatened because sharks develop slowly and do not reproduce as quickly as other types of fish., or unwanted catch, in nets meant for tuna and swordfish. Some scientists think that tighter laws on fishing could protect sharks. For example, some sharks, or move to another place, along set paths at certain times of the year. Some scientists say that preventing fishing during those times might help protect sharks from being accidentally killed.Another risk to sharks are the people who kill them for their fins, which are used to make shark-fin soup. The United States prohibits that practice.The decline in the shark population has scientists worried. All plants and animals in the ocean depend on one another for food. The link between them is called theSharks are predators at the top of the food chain. A predator is an animal that survives by eating other animals. Sharks hunt, or prey upon, other animals such as seals and tuna. Seals and tuna eat smaller fish. Those smaller fish feed on tiny fish and ocean plants.""Sharks are adapted to being the predators, not the prey,"" said one scientist. Scientists say that if sharks are wiped out, it would negatively impact other marine life in the food chain.What do you think should be done to protect sharks? Discuss in class. Then let us know in the Write On section ofThe food chain links plants and animals together. They depend on one another for food. The ocean food chain begins with sea plants called phytoplankton.

2	"A rover like this one is making its way across the surface of Mars in search of life.Here is one question that many people ask: Is there, or has there ever been, life on Mars?Scientists are hoping to answer that question. In late June and early July, NASA launched two robot vehicles called, the rovers weigh about 400 pounds each and are about the size of golf carts. The rovers are scheduled to land on the Red Planet in January 2004. Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a dark red color.Don't expect the rovers to find little green aliens on the fourth planet from the sun. Instead, they will be on the lookout for signs that water once flowed on Mars. They will also search for evidence that some ice exists under the planet's surface. Scientists say that evidence of water on Mars can mean that life once existed on this planet.Unlike Earth, Mars is dusty, very cold, and dry. ""We're going to look for signs that tell us that Mars may have been warmer and wet in the past,"" said aStill, Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in the solar system. It has mountains, valleys, ice caps, and dry riverbeds.The Red Planet even has seasons, wind and dust storms, and a rocky surface.The seven-month journey for the rovers won't be an easy one. So far, only three of nine spacecraft that Americans and Russians have sent to Mars have completed the journey without breaking apart or failing.The rovers were launched from a rocket and will travel through space in a protective shell. They will use parachutes and air bags to bounce to their landing sites. They will land on opposite sides of the planet.The rovers are equipped with robotic arms, special tools, and cameras. As part of their mission, they will drill through rocks on Mars' surface and take pictures of them.Then, they will then send the pictures back to Earth for scientists to study. Each rover can travel about the length of a football field each day.""We will be using the rovers to find rocks and soils that could hold clues about [the possibility of water in] Mars' past,"" said another NASA scientist.Missions to Mars typically occur when the two planets are close to each other. Mars recently made its closest pass to Earth in 60,000 years. On August 27, Mars was only about 34 million miles from Earth.Distance from Earth on August 27, 2003:Besides the moon, Mars will be the brightest object in the southeastern sky through early October. Many people are jumping at the chance to get a rare look at the Red Planet. Manyaround the country have been flooded with stargazers excited to get a peek at Mars.

They consisted simply of a butcher pointing to the different parts of a body, while the lecturer read a text by an authority such as Galen.Although students did debate the ideas of Galen, any new ideas were judged on the debating skills of the student,. The Church said that Galen's ideas were so correct that there was no need to investigate any further.Generally, the Church forbade the dissection of human bodies, so knowledge was hard to come by - and ignorance led toand misunderstandings on the part of Medieval doctors. For example, the Italian doctor Alderotti claimed that combing the hair 'comforts the brain'.This illustration is by Leonhart Thurn-Heisser(1574) and represents the four humoursAlthough many Medieval doctors continued to believe in the theory of theFour bodily fluids - yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm - used in ancient times to analyse and describe people's state of health., they also said disease was caused by demons, sin, bad smells, astrology and the stars, stagnant water, the Jewish people etc.Ultimately, they believed that life was controlled by God and his saints, and a plague such as the Black Death was seen as a punishment from God. Guy de Chauliac, the Pope's doctor, blamed the Black Death on a conjunction of Saturn, Jupiter and Mars.Things were different only in the Muslim Middle East where, during the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786-809), the books of Hippocrates were. At first, Muslim doctors like al-Razi ('Rhazes known as the Galen of Islam') conserved the ideas of the Greeks and Romans.Later, Muslim doctors such as Avenzoar and Ibn an Nafis actually began toand to develop new ideas. However because the Christian Church was at war with Islam, Muslim ideas spread onlyto western Europe. The exception was a book by Ibn Sina (often known as Avicenna) - the 'Canon of Medicine'.A Doctor too emerged as we proceeded.No one alive could talk as well as he didOn points of medicine and of surgeryAnd, by his Natural Magic, knew what areThe cause of every malady you'd gotHe knew, and whether dry, cold, moist or hot;He knew their seat, their humour and condition.Were ready with the drugs he would prescribeAnd each made money from the other's guile(They had been friendly for a goodish while)And lined with taffeta, he rode his way;Yet he was rather close as to expensesAnd kept the gold he won in pestilences.What can Chaucer tell historians about medicine in Medieval times?Were doctors in Medieval times hated or fêted?Question 1- what can Chaucer tell historians about medicine in Medieval times?Chaucer tells historians that there was a huge range of different ideas and superstitions - astronomy, magic, charms, the four humours, drugs, acceptance of the authority of the ancients.Question 2 - were doctors in Medieval times hated or fêted?Chaucer clearly disliked the doctor he described: - 'No one alive could talk as well as he did' - 'Each made money from the other's guile' - '[He] kept the gold he won in pestilences'Patients, however, continued to flock to the doctor, and must have thought he had something to offer, otherwise he would not have been so rich.

4	The reactivity of the halogens decreases as we move down the group. This can be shown by looking atWhen chlorine (as a gas or dissolved in water) is added to sodium bromide solution the chlorine takes the place of the bromine. Because chlorine is more reactive than bromine, it displaces bromine from sodium bromide. The solution turns brown. This brown colour is the displaced bromine. The chlorine has gone to form sodium chloride.If you look at the equation, you can see that the Cl and Br have swapped places.chlorine + sodium bromide → sodium chloride + bromine(aq) + 2NaBr(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + BrThis type of reaction happens with all of the halogens. A more reactive halogen displaces a less reactive halogen from a solution of one of its salts.If you test different combinations of the halogens and their salts, you can work out a reactivity series for Group 7. The most reactive halogen displaces all of the other halogens from solutions of their salts, and is itself displaced by none of the others. The least reactive halogen displaces none of the others, and is itself displaced by all of the others.

It is an important factor in the chemical weathering of rocks.[an error occurred while processing this directive], due to the combination of high rainfall and impermeable rock.V shaped river valleys formed by the numerous surface streams. Valley sides are steep due to the resistant nature of the granite.Contour lines are found close together on a map.The land is at a higher altitude than the surrounding area due to the resistant nature of the rock.Most of the large settlements, eg Tavistock, and Ashburton are found near the outskirts of Dartmoor.An abandoned tin mine at Botallack on the West Penwith coast of Cornwall. Kaolin, also known as china clay, is a product of hydrolysis and is used in ceramics and papermaking. The industry is very important for employment and the local economy.. Granite blocks were used for dry stone walling, buildings and road stone. Many quarries are now abandoned.. Dartmoor is a National Park. It is popular for walking, camping and pony trekking and over 10 million people a year visit the area.. The soils are poor and acidic, and frequently used for sheep farming rather than growing crops.. Copper and tin mining used to be common. The metals were found in thin 'veins' within the granite.Quarrying, mining and china clay extraction can leave scars on the landscape. This makes it less attractive for both tourists and locals.Tourism causes pollution and congestion on the roads. Tourist activities can sometimes lead to conflict with locals.Tourists buying second homes pushes property prices up which means locals cannot afford to buy. Rural poverty is becoming a problem in areas such as Dartmoor.Case study: limestone in the Yorkshire DalesLimestone is a sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcium carbonate. It is commonly used as a building stone.in the UK is found in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, near Malham and Ingleton.Limestone is a sedimentary rock made of calcium carbonate.It dissolves slowly in carbonic acid (carbon dioxide and rainwater) creating a range of distinctive landforms.The structure of limestone is like building blocks, with joints (vertical) and bedding planes (horizontal) separating the blocks.Most weathering takes place between the blocks where the acidic rainwater can penetrate: limestone is a pervious rock.[an error occurred while processing this directive]nature of the rock, drainage is usually underground and can only be seen where the limestone meets an area ofWhen a substance is described as impermeable it means that fluids, especially water, are unable to pass through it.rock. This process can be seem in the appearance of natural springs and is known as 'resurgence'.. This is where the acidic rainwater has dissolved and widened a joint in the limestone, and surface streams disappear underground, eg Gaping Gill near Ingleborough.. Where limestone has been exposed at the surface due to erosion, the joints become widened to leave dips between the blocks of rock called 'grikes'. The blocks are called 'clints'. There is an excellent example of limestone pavement above Malham Cove in North Yorkshire.. These were eroded by fast flowing surface streams towards the end of the last ice age when the ground was either frozen or saturated with glacial meltwater. The streams flow underground today, eg The Dry Valley of Watlowes near Malham.. If the roof of an underground cave system collapses due to extensive limestone solution, it leaves a stream flowing at the base of a deep narrow valley.. These are found when a stream flowing down a swallow hole has dissolved a large area underground. Deposits of limestone hanging down from the ceiling are called stalactites; those found on the floor of a cave are called stalagmites.. Limestone is quarried in the Yorkshire Dales and is very important for the local economy. Limestone is used for building stone, cement and fertilizer. Limestone is also used in the steel industry, eg Castle Bolton quarry in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire.. Tourists visit the area for walking, camping, climbing, potholing, caving, educational visits and for the distinctive scenery. Over 8 million visitors provide employment and an important boost to the local economy, where farming has become less profitable.. Sheep farming is common - the soils are thin and unsuitable for any other type of farming. Some farmers diversify into camping and bed and breakfast accommodation.'Honeypot' sites such as Malham become congested with cars and tourists, causing conflict with the local people.Ramblers can cause conflict with farmers when they drop litter and leave gates open.Some tourists buy second homes which can push property prices up to the point where local people cannot afford them.Case study: chalk in the South Downs- an area of outstanding natural beauty.Chalk is a sedimentary rock made of calcium carbonate.It is porous and allows water to penetrate into the rock. For this reason, surface streams (winterbournes) are only visible when the rock is saturated.Dry valleys are a common feature. These were eroded by fast flowing surface streams towards the end of the last ice age.Where the chalk meets an impermeable rock (frequently clay) springs can be seen where rivers begin to flow at the surface.Soils are thin which means vegetation is mainly grasses.Chalk forms gentle hills inland (eg the South Downs in southern England) and steep cliffs at the coast (eg the Seven Sisters in Sussex).[an error occurred while processing this directive]have a gentle slope (or dip) on one side and a steeper slope (or scarp) on the other.Chalk beds are good natural aquifers. Aquifiers are underground areas that allow storage of water due to the porous nature of the rock.. Mainly sheep, racehorses and some cows are farmed. Soils are too thin to allow much arable farming..Where chalk meets clay, spring line settlements can be seen, eg Fulking in West Sussex. Due to the good access to London, the South Downs are popular with commuters and retired people.. For example at Epsom in Surrey.. Chalk with flints is a strong building material used in cement manufacture.Clay is a sedimentary rock made of tiny particles which come from the weathering of other rocks and minerals.The particles can be transported by rivers or ice and then deposited.Clay vales are frequently found at the foot of chalk escarpments, eg in the South Downs of Southern England.Clay collapses easily when wet (slumping) and forms gentle landscapes, which are frequently waterlogged.When a substance is described as impermeable it means that fluids, especially water, are unable to pass through it.and is characterised by having many surface streams.Clay is high in nutrients and is not eroded easily.. Clay is used in making pots, bricks and the manufacturing of paper.. The main land use is farming due to clay's high nutrient content and the characteristically flat landscape which makes it accessible to farm machinery. The land is used for arable farming, market gardening and dairy farming.

They can also be used as fuels, for example as biodiesel.Food additives are chemicals added by food manufacturers to certain foods, including vegetable oils, to improve their shelf-life, taste and appearance.Vegetable oils are natural oils found in seeds, nuts and some fruit.to squeeze the oil out. Olive oil is obtained this way. Sometimes the oil is more difficult to extract and has to be. Once the oil is dissolved, the solvent is removed by distillation, and impurities such as water are also removed, to leave pure vegetable oil. Sunflower oil is obtained in this way.. Glycerol has three carbon atoms and fatty acids have long chains of carbon atoms.In the diagram below you can see how three long chains of carbon atoms are attached to a glycerol molecule, with its three carbon atoms. Together they combine to make one molecule of vegetable oil.The structure of a vegetable oil moleculeThe long fatty acid chains stop vegetable oils dissolving in water.The fatty acids in some vegetable oils are, and only have single bonds between their carbon atoms. Saturated oils tend to be, and are sometimes called vegetable fats instead of oils. Lard is an example of a saturated oil.The fatty acids in some vegetable oils are, and have double bonds between some of their carbon atoms. Unsaturated oils tend to be, and are useful for frying food.

For example, willow bark was used by the ancient Greeks to help cure fevers and pains. It was later discovered that the active ingredient was salicylic acid. This was modified by chemists into the substance we call aspirin, which is less irritating to the stomach than salicylic acid.New medical drugs have to be tested to ensure they work and are safe before they can be prescribed. There are three main stages:The drugs are tested using computer models and human cells grown in the laboratory. Many substances fail this test because they damage cells or do not seem to work.Drugs that pass the first stage are tested on animals. In the UK, new medicines have to be. But it is illegal to test cosmetics and tobacco products on them. A typical test involves giving a known amount of the substance to the animals, then monitoring them carefully for any side-effects.Drugs that have passed animal tests are used in clinical trials. They are tested on healthy volunteers to check they are safe. The substances are then tested on people with the illness to ensure they are safe and work.You may wish to view this BBC News item from 2006 about a drugs trial that left six volunteers very ill.Most substances do not pass all the tests and trials, so drug development is expensive and takes a long time.Medical drug trials are not without risk.

The writing identifies whose bones were placed in the box. In English, the carving says, ""James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.""As soon as historians learned what the writing on the box meant, they wanted to know more. For example, they wanted to know if the Jesus mentioned in the carving was Jesus of Nazareth.The writing on the box poses a problem. James, Joseph, and Jesus were very common names at the time the box was made. Historians had to use math tohow many people named James had a father named Joseph and a brother named Jesus. They learned that only 20 people could have been the James mentioned in the carving.Of the hundreds of bone boxes that have been found, only two others mention a brother's name. Historians say the Jesus mentioned on the box must have been a very important person.Did the bone box belong to a brother of Jesus? Some historians say Jesus had brothers or half-brothers. Others say Jesus only had cousins.Regardless of whose bones were placed in the box, the discovery is important to historians.

Sheep are abundant on the islands of New Zealand, which are located southeast of Australia in the Pacific Ocean.After years of roaming in the wild, Shrek was caught. Sixty pounds of Shrek's wool was, or cut, with scissors before a crowd on television. That was enough wool to make 20 suits!Shearers left a thin layer of wool on Shrek and gave him a special coat to keep him warm. Shrek's owner donated the wool to a charity for children.When students at the Tarras School in New Zealand learned of Shrek, they created a children's book called Shrek:. Their book tells the story of Shrek through the eyes of children who have followed his life from long hair to no hair.Students sold the book at a school fundraiser.

2	"On September 11, the foundations of some of America's most famous landmarks were reduced to rubble by terrorist attacks. But the foundations of the United States are not as fragile as those buildings. To prove that point, millions of Americans have come together to help one another.President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives.""By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.""Sometimes the owners feel so guilty that they abandoned their pets,"" said Jennifer Olsen of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But it is so gratifying to see them when they reunite with their pets after all this time.""The rescued animals included cats, dogs, birds, and even a, a kind of lizard. To get to the gecko, named Little Dude, rescue workers had to climb stairs to the 39th floor of a building. Despite that obstacle, Little Dude was reunited with its owner.Whether rescue workers cleared rubble, looked for and helped survivors, or retrieved lost pets, their heroic efforts made all Americans proud to be Americans.

3	> The Tempest first key extract - PerformanceThe Tempest first key extract - PerformanceWhen you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:The characters and how you respond to themThe language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for exampleThe issues and ideas - like love, magic and powerThe performance instructions, such as stage directionsMore from The Tempest first key extract:Up for a challenge?

4	The atmosphere has not always been the same. It has been much the same, but nevertheless now contains more nitrogen and oxygen, and less carbon dioxide, than it did when the earth first formed. Recently, the addition of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels has lead to global warming.It is difficult to predict, even by using computer models, exactly what the mean temperature of the Earth will be in the future. However it seems sensible to limit global warming and protect the environment, through sustainable development and by reducing waste, wherever possible.Scientists believe that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Its early atmosphere was probably formed from the gases given out by volcanoes. It is believed that there was intense volcanic activity for the first billion years of the Earth's existence.The early atmosphere was probably mostly carbon dioxide, with little or no oxygen. There were small quantities of water vapour, ammonia and methane. As the Earth cooled down, most of the water vapour condensed and formed the oceans.So how did the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go down, and the proportion of oxygen go up?The proportion of oxygen went up because of photosynthesis by plants.The proportion of carbon dioxide went down because:it was locked up in sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, and in fossil fuelsit was absorbed by plants for photosynthesisThe burning of fossil fuels is adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere faster than it can be removed. This means that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing.Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs heat energy and prevents it escaping into space. This keeps the Earth warm enough for liquid water and living things to exist on it. Greenhouse gases are not a bad thing in themselves. But too much of them in the atmosphere leads to global warming, where the average temperature of the Earth rises quickly.Carbon dioxide is produced by burning fossil fuels. Because of this, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased, especially in the last one hundred years.Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th centuryAs the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased, so too has the average global temperature. Notice that the temperature has increased a lot from around 1860, when the increase in concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to be clear.The temperature of the earth has risen over the yearsIt has taken a long time for it to be generally accepted that the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a cause of global warming. There has been uncertainty in some of the data but this has reduced as more data has been collected. Computer models help us to predict that an increase of only a few degrees will cause changes to the Earth's climate. This is why it is important to attempt to combat global warming, for example by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.A mountain of household and industrial rubbishPollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Evencommon household items can contain toxic chemicalssuch as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.Industrial waste is also discharged onto the landchemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage cropsto improve their crops, but these can damage living things. Toxic chemicals can be washed from the land into rivers, lakes and seas.Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and landWater pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas.kills aquatic organisms and harms human healthkill aquatic organisms and harm human healthThe resources on the Earth are limited. It is important that the things we do now do not make things difficult or impossible for future generations. To achieve sustainable development, we need to balance these things carefully:the need for economic development, where standards of living improverespect for the environment and the resources it provides for usRecycling is an important way to help us achieve sustainable development. We can recycle many resources, including:Glass is easily recycled. It can be melted and remoulded to make new objects, such as bottles. The energy needed to do this is less than the energy needed to make new glass from its raw materials. However, we need to sort different coloured glass ready for recycling, and transport it to the recycling plant.Just like glass, it takes less energy to melt and remould metals than it does to extract new metals from their ores. Aluminium is a valuable metal that melts at a relatively low temperature, and is particularly attractive for recycling. However, a lot of metals that we use are mixtures called alloys, and it can be difficult to sort different metals ready for recycling.Paper is not melted when it is recycled. Instead, it is broken up into small pieces and reformed to make new sheets of paper. This takes less energy to do than making paper from trees. However, paper can only be recycled a few times before its fibres become too short to be useful, and the recycled paper is often only good enough for toilet paper or cardboard. But it can be used as a fuel or compost instead.from 2006 about a new school in Birmingham where most of the waste produced during its construction was recycled.

4	The elements in Group 7 of the Periodic Table are called the halogens. They include chlorine, bromine and iodine. The halogens are diatomic - this means they exist as molecules, each with a pair of atoms. Chlorine molecules have the formula ClThe halogens show trends in physical properties down the group.The halogens have low melting points and boiling points. This is a typical property of non-metals. Fluorine has the lowest melting point and boiling point. The melting points and boiling points then increase as you go down the group.Melting and boiling points of Group 7 elementsRoom temperature is usually taken as being 25°C. At this temperature, fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine and astatine are solids. There is therefore a trend in state from gas to liquid to solid down the group.The halogens become darker as you go down the group. Fluorine is very pale yellow, chlorine is yellow-green, and bromine is red-brown. Iodine crystals are shiny purple - but easily turn into a dark purple vapour when they are warmed up.When we can see a trend in the properties of some of the elements in a group, it is possible to predict the properties of other elements in that group. Astatine is below iodine in Group 7. The colour of these elements gets darker as you go down the group. Iodine is purple, and, as we would expect, astatine is black.as you go down the group. Fluorine, at the top of the group, is the most reactive halogen. It is extremely dangerous, causing severe chemical burns on contact with skin.The halogens react with metals to make salts calledFor example, sodium reacts with chlorine to make sodium chloride (common salt).The reaction between sodium and a halogen becomesas we move down Group 7. Fluorine reacts violently with sodium at room temperature. Chlorine reacts very vigorously when in contact with hot sodium. Iodine reacts slowly with hot sodium.. They will remove the colour of dyes. Chlorine is used to bleach wood pulp to make white paper.. Chlorine is added to drinking water at very low concentrations. This kills any harmful bacteria in the water, making it safe to drink. Chlorine is also added to the water in swimming pools.Because the halogens are very reactive and poisonous, care must be taken when using them. Chlorine is used only in a fume cupboard. Iodine should not be handled (it will damage the skin). Gloves may be used, and goggles should be worn.The reactivity of the halogens decreases as we move down the group. This can be shown by looking atWhen chlorine (as a gas or dissolved in water) is added to sodium bromide solution the chlorine takes the place of the bromine. Because chlorine is more reactive than bromine, it displaces bromine from sodium bromide. The solution turns brown. This brown colour is the displaced bromine. The chlorine has gone to form sodium chloride.If you look at the equation, you can see that the Cl and Br have swapped places.chlorine + sodium bromide → sodium chloride + bromine(aq) + 2NaBr(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + BrThis type of reaction happens with all of the halogens. A more reactive halogen displaces a less reactive halogen from a solution of one of its salts.If you test different combinations of the halogens and their salts, you can work out a reactivity series for Group 7. The most reactive halogen displaces all of the other halogens from solutions of their salts, and is itself displaced by none of the others. The least reactive halogen displaces none of the others, and is itself displaced by all of the others. It works just the same whether you use sodium salts or potassium salts.The animation shows what happens when chlorine, bromine and iodine are added to various halogen salts.

Hazard symbols are used to identify the danger posed by each chemical and what care should be taken.Concentrated solutions of strong acids and strong alkalis are labelled with the ‘corrosive’ symbol. Anyone using a corrosive substance should wear gloves and eye protection, such as goggles or a face shield.Dilute solutions of acids and alkalis are labelled with the ‘irritant’ symbol. Anyone using an irritant substance should wear eye protection such as goggles, and they should take care to wash any spills off their skin immediately.Very poisonous chemicals are labelled with the ‘toxic’ symbol. Anyone who uses a toxic chemical needs to take great care. They should wear gloves and eye protection, and they may wear a mask over their mouth and nose, or handle the chemical in a fume cupboard.Less poisonous chemicals are labelled with the ‘harmful’ symbol. Anyone using a harmful substance should wear eye protection such as goggles, and they should take care to wash any spills off their skin immediately.Chemicals that ignite very easily are labelled with the ‘highly flammable’ symbol. In addition to the normal precautions of wearing eye protection, anyone using a highly flammable substance should take care to keep it away from flames and sparks, and also from oxidising substances.Oxidising substances do not burn themselves, but they provide oxygen for flammable substances to burn. They are labelled with the ‘oxidising’ symbol. In addition to the normal precautions of wearing eye protection, anyone using an oxidising substance should take care to keep it away from flammable substances, including clothing.

The Soviet despot for years had cried out at the 'fascist beasts' and called for peace-loving states to band together to halt the Nazi aggression.William Shirer, ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" (1959)Can you see any similarities between Source A and Source B?Shirer echoes the idea represented in the cartoon that Russia and Germany had hated each other for years, and the cartoon's other idea that they were just pretending to like each other for their ""sordid"" deal.Read Source C below written by two modern historiansThe pact left Britain and France to fight Germany alone. Hitler did not really believe they would go to war over Poland, but almost had second thoughts when Britain's reaction to the Pact was the signing of a formal alliance with Poland on 25 August 1939. This time Britain and France would not be able to back down ... But the Anglo-Polish alliance did not change anything. It only took a few days for Hitler to recover his nerve and order that Poland be invaded on 1 September.Nigel Kelly and Greg Lacey, Modern World History (2001)ways Source C suggests the Nazi-Soviet Pact brought war nearer.It left Britain and France to fight Germany alone, and Hitler did not really believe they would go to war over Poland.It led Britain to sign an alliance with Poland on 25 August 1939, so they could not back down.It encouraged Hitler to recover his nerve.As part of your revision, think about theStalin chose an alliance with Nazi Germany, rather than an alliance with France and Britain.the Nazi-Soviet pact astonished the world, and was called by one historian ""the greatest diplomatic bombshell of the century""."

Each spring, tens of millions of monarchs from Mexico head north. In the fall, they will fly to Mexico for the winter months.Elizabeth Howard created the Web site Journey North. The site studies monarchs and tracks their travel patterns. ""They travel farther than any other migratory animal or insect on the planet,"" she says. ""What's most amazing is they go to the same place every winter [and spring], even though they've never been there before.""People who track monarchs are worried that the butterflies will becomeor at risk of dying out completely. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning forests. The butterflies seek shelter in forest trees during the winter. Increasing temperatures are also threatening the butterflies' survival.""There is a good chance that we will see big changes in the monarchs' migratory patterns in the next several decades,"" says monarch expert Karen Oberhauser. ""My hope is that monarchs will be able to adapt.""Some monarch butterflies live for just a few weeks. Others may live up to eight months. Each butterfly races to complete its leg of the journey and produce the next generation before it dies. Parent butterflies leave Mexico in March. Their children are born in the southern United States. Those butterflies travel north. Grandchildren butterflies are produced in the north, where they spend July. Finally, it is the great-grandchild of the first butterfly that returns to Mexico. It will remain there for the winter.Why might people want to save monarchs?All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

The Romans understood that dirty conditions made people ill, and provided many facilities - such as- to promote public health. They had every incentive to do this, as they wanted the soldiers in their army to remain healthy, in order to keep the empire under control.Three important factors combined to cause them to create a public health system. Their suspicion of, their realisation that the army needed hygienic conditions to keep theirLike the Greeks, the Romans believed in personal health and hygiene - the writer Juvenal coined the phrase""a healthy mind in a healthy body"". The Roman writer Celsus advised exercises before a meal, and bathing weak parts of the body (copying Hippocrates's, 'Programme for Health'). Galen prescribed gym exercises and deep breathing as a way to health.Settlements such as army camps, were sited in healthy places (not near swamps). In other places marshes were(Julius Caesar drained the Codetan swamp near Rome), which reduced malaria.The Romans were great builders, and among their amazing constructions were aqueducts, baths, sewers and hospitals.Rome had nine aqueducts (note the excellent engineering, including conduits, inverted syphons, bridges and filter tanks) which broughtof water a day into the city. They also built many great aqueducts throughout their empire. In Rome, special commissioners monitored cleanliness and a fair supply. Most private houses had cisterns and pipes.Roman aqueduct, Pont du Gard, across the River Gard near Nimes, FranceRome had nine public baths. Many of them were, 'covered with mirrors buried in glass lined with marble and silver'. For a fee of one sixteenth of a denarius bathers went from the hot 'caldarium' to the lukewarm 'tepidarium' and then dipped in the cold 'frigidarium'. Many baths had gymnasia and massage rooms attached. Government officials calledRome had seven sewers (notably the Cloaca Maxima, which was large enough for a laden wagon to pass through), and public latrines (seating up to 60 people). There was a force of 300 slaves who cleaned the streets and latrines at night while people were asleep.real hospitals in order to look after their. The first hospitals in Rome were the valetudinaria (free hospitals) for former soldiers.Think about your answer to the question below as you look over the facts and ideas in the Roman section.Why did the Romans want to develop public health?As you read, note down when you can confirm one of the following possible answers:They needed to keep the army healthy:""I will give you some ideas about how the army can be kept healthy, by the siting of camps, purity of water, temperature and exercise""They were suspicious of the Greek doctors they had brought to Rome as slaves.They believed in prevention rather than cure.They objected to paying the doctors (Pliny could not see why they should""pay fees to profiteers in order to save their lives""They had ideas about disease which encouraged public health measures. (Varro advised Romans not to build near swamps or drains because""tiny creatures float through the air and enter the body and cause disease"". Columella blamed disease on poisonous vapours from the swamps. The Water Commissioner Frontinus said that the aqueducts made the city cleaner and removed the causes of the unhealthy air.)They had the necessary wealth and power. They were wealthy enough to build the infrastructure and powerful enough to requisition/pay for the necessary materials and labour. They had excellent engineering skills - as seen in the Pont du Gard aqueduct in France."

The slope on a velocity-time graph represents the acceleration of an object. The distance travelled is equal to the area under a velocity-time graph.You should recall from your Key Stage 3 studies how to calculate the speed of an object from the distance travelled and the time taken.When an object moves in a straight line at a steady speed, you can calculate its speed if you know how far it travels and how long it takes. This equation shows the relationship between speed, distance travelled and time taken:For example, a car travels 300 metres in 20 seconds.Its speed is 300 ÷ 20 = 15m/s.Check your understanding of this topic by having a go at this activity.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

When an object is moving at a steady speed, the line on the graph is straight, but sloped.The diagram shows some typical lines on a distance-time graph.Note that the steeper the line, the greater the speed of the object. The blue line is steeper than the red because it represents an object moving faster than the one represented by the red line.The red lines on the graph represent a typical journey where an object returns to the start again.

4	Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons. These are separated into useful products, such as fuels, using a process called fractional distillation.The demand for short hydrocarbon molecules is greater than their supply in crude oil, so a reaction called cracking is used. Cracking converts long alkane molecules into shorter alkanes and alkenes, which are more useful. The exploitation of oil can damage the environment - for example, through oil spills.. They were formed over millions of years, from the remains of dead organisms:crude oil and gas were formed from dead sea creatures- there is only a limited supply of them in the Earth’s crust. They took so long to form that they cannot be replaced once they have been used up. They areCrude oil is found trapped in some of therocks formed from compacted sediment (remains of living things or fragments of other rocks)Millions of years ago, huge numbers of microscopic animals and plants - plankton - died and fell to the bottom of the sea. Their remains were covered by mud.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

It works when the liquids have different boiling points. Distillation is commonly used to- the alcohol in alcoholic drinks -Distillation process to separate ethanol from waterStep 1 - water and ethanol solution are heatedDistillation process to separate ethanol from waterStep 2 - the ethanol evaporates first, cools, then condensesDistillation process to separate ethanol from waterStep 3 - the water left evaporates, cools, then condensesThe mixture is heated in a flask. Ethanol has a lower boiling point than water so it evaporates first. The ethanol vapour is then cooled and condensed inside the condenser to form a pure liquid. The thermometer shows the boiling point of the pure ethanol liquid. When all the ethanol has evaporated from the solution, the temperature rises and the water evaporates.This is the sequence of events in distillation:heating    →    evaporating    →    cooling    →    condensingFractional distillation differs from distillation only in that it separates a mixture into a number of different parts, called fractions. A tall column is fitted above the mixture, with several condensers coming off at different heights. The column is hot at the bottom and cool at the top. Substances with high boiling points condense at the bottom, and substances with low boiling points condense at the top. Like distillation, fractional distillation works because the different substances in the mixture have different boiling points.Because they have different boiling points, the substances in crude oil can be separated using fractional distillation. The crude oil is evaporated, and its vapours allowed to condense at different temperatures in the fractionating column. Each fraction contains hydrocarbon molecules with a similar number of carbon atoms.The diagram below summarises the main fractions from crude oil, their uses, and the trends in properties. Note that the gases condense at the top of the column, the liquids in the middle, while the solids stay at the bottom.Here are the main fractions in list. They are in increasing order from small molecules - gases - to large ones.- contains propane and butane, used in bottled cooking gas- fuel for ships and power stationsHydrocarbons with small molecules make better fuels than hydrocarbons with large molecules, because they are volatile, flow easily, and are easily ignited.Geologists can often tell where oil is trapped by looking at the structure of the rocks. Oil tends to be trapped where rocks are domed upwards, or where permeable rocks are in contact with impermeable rocks at a fault line.Oil companies can drill down through the impermeable rocks to get it out. They are then able to turn the oil into products we can use.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

Present estimates suggest world supplies of crude oil will run out in about 30 years, unless we use it more efficiently. There are additional reserves of oil in rocks called oil shale. However, it is expensive to extract oil from oil shale because it needs to be heated to release the oil.Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and landOil is carried from oil fields to refineries using ocean-going tankers. If the oil is spilled, it causes considerable damage to the environment:oil slicks travel across the sea, far from the original spillbeaches and wildlife are harmed when they are coated with oilFuels made from oil mixtures containing largeHydrocarbons are a group of compounds which contain the elements hydrogen and carbon.molecules are not efficient. They do not flow easily, and are difficult to ignite. Crude oil often contains too many large hydrocarbon molecules, and not enough small hydrocarbon molecules, to meet demand. This is whereCracking allows large hydrocarbon molecules to be broken down into smaller alkane and alkene molecules:smaller hydrocarbons are more useful as fuelsalkenes are useful, because they are used to make polymersFractions containing large hydrocarbon molecules are vaporised and passed over a hot catalyst.

Today, there are more than 3,000.As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list ofEndangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.As Florida’s human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of theirAs builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees’ natural homes.Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We can’t celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview withState officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Florida’s list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nation’s Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say it’s not unusual for manatees toor move from one place to another.

Covered with mud, Irwin wrestles with the reptile and finally ties up its snout and legs. The out-of-breath hunter then stands in front of the croc and declares, ""She's a beauty!""Irwin is the star of the hit TV show. In the United States, 60 million viewers see the wildlife show each week. The show is watched by people in 122 countries around the world.Irwin, age 38, has been interested in animals and the environment since he was a child. He grew up in a wildlife park in Queensland, a state in Australia. For his sixth birthday, Irwin's parents gave him a 12-foot snake called a scrub python. At age 9, Irwin captured his first crocodile. Ten years ago, Irwin took over the park that his parents had started. Five years ago, his show aired on American TV for the first time.is about more than wrestling crocodiles, snakes, and other wild animals, Irwin says. He explained that the show is also about making people aware of problems facing many animals.""We don't run around capturing wildlife for the fun of it,"" Irwin said. ""Our love is to educate and share with the world threatened wildlife. We want to bring animals into your house so that we can share and learn about them.""For example, Irwin was recently on the Australian island of Tasmania. Irwin was working with the World Wildlife Fund to rescue stranded whales. He wants to call attention to whale hunting in the South Pacific Ocean. ""This practice [whaling] has to stop,"" Irwin said.Not everyone agrees that Irwin's show is good for animals or the environment.Kent Vliet does not like ""the haphazard way in which [Irwin] handles snakes and gets bitten."" Vliet is a reptile expert who has worked for the National Geographic Society. Vliet fears that viewers might copy the croc hunter's dangerous moves and get hurt.Instead of wrestling animals, Vliet said, Irwin should talk more about protecting endangered animals and the environment.For now, the croc hunter said he will keep on wrestling crocs and snakes and bringing people up close with some of Earth's endangered animals. ""I will continue to put my life on the line to save wildlife,"" he said.

3	"> Explore, imagine and entertain - Short-storiesA short-story is easy to write if you:Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more.Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - don’t start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.Can you match Viral Vinnie's appetite for English, Maths and Science?The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

2	"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
3	> Introduction to equations - Balancing the equationIntroduction to equations - Balancing the equationAn equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:Divide both sides by 2, to give:a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.Whack and zap mad professors and aliens!The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

2	"Alhaji Babah Sawane was only 10 years old when a rebel group kidnapped him in his African country of Sierra Leone. Taken from his family, he was forced to learn how to fire a rifle. He fought in an army for the next two and a half years.Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
2	"Tarantulas are found in warm regions, including the southwestern United States.Does thinking about spiders and their hairy bodies, long legs, and sticky webs make your skin crawl? Many people shiver at the thought of spiders.That is not the case for Rich Bradley, a real-life Spider-Man. He can't get enough of the creepy crawlers. Bradley is an(ah-rak-NAH-luh-jist). That is a scientist who studies spiders. Bradley has spent the last 10 years identifying and studying spiders in his home state of Ohio., or types, of spiders living in the Buckeye State. He and his team of volunteers have a sharp eye when it comes to collecting the creatures indoors and outdoors. ""They move really fast,"" he toldScientists say about 3,500 species of spiders live in North America, and nearly 35,000 live worldwide. Spiders live in different places, including gardens, water, deserts, and caves.Many people think spiders are insects, but they are actually(ah-RAK-nidz). Ticks and scorpions are also arachnids.Along with fangs and eight hairy legs, a spider has two body parts--a head and an abdomen. The abdomen contains, organs that produce silk. A spider uses its silk for many purposes, including weaving webs, protecting its eggs, and catching food.A spider uses its silk to weave a web., or hunters that eat other animals. They dine mostly on insects. Some larger spiders also eat lizards, frogs, and even snakes.To capture their food, some spiders spin webs. Other types of spiders chase down their, or poison, from their fangs helps paralyze their food.Although the hairy creatures spook many people, there isn't much reason to be afraid of spiders. ""Most spiders are not very dangerous,"" said Bradley.In fact, most are timid creatures that are unable to give humans more than a harmless bite. Although spider venom is deadly to insects, it often has little effect on humans because of our larger size.Spiders may have a bad reputation for being scary, but they are important to us. Bradley hopes his work shatters someabout spiders. (A myth is a false idea that many people believe is true.)Spiders eat mosquitoes and other insects that harm farmers' crops and carry diseases. Bradley's research is teaching scientists more about how spiders help control, or communities of plants and animals. If spiders didn't exist, there would be a lot more insects!""Spiders are your friends,"" Bradley said. ""They make our life more pleasant.""Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders.Can you guess how this spider got its name? It may not live in the ocean, but it looks like a crab. The crab spider lives on flowers. It can match its body color to the flower's color. That allows it to sneak up on insects.What a leap! The jumping spider can jump between 10 and 40 inches. To catch an insect, this hunting spider sneaks up on its prey and pounces.The trap-door spider lives in a tunnel. The spider, common in the southwestern United States, lines the tunnel with silk and fashions a door made of silk and dirt. It peeks out of the slightly open door and grabs passing insects.The tarantula is a large, hairy spider found mainly in warm regions, including the southwestern United States. Although the tarantula's bite is painful, it is not very poisonous to humans. Tarantulas hunt insects, lizards, mice, toads, and frogs.E. B. White's famous spider Charlotte was an orb weaver.

2	Journey to the Center of the EarthWhat's under your feet? If you look at the ground, that question is answered easily. But dig a little deeper-about 4,000 miles deeper. That's where you will find Earth's core.No one has ever journeyed to the center of Earth. However, scientists are trying to figure out what's there.For a long time scientists believed that Earth's core is made of solid iron and nickel metals. Now, according to a new theory, or idea, a powerful nuclear reactor is located in Earth's core.Earth may not be the only planet in the solar system that houses a nuclear reactor. Some scientists say nuclear reactions occur at the centers of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.All four of those planets give off, or radiate, more energy than they get from the sun. The scientists say a large energy source must lie hidden deep inside those planets.Inside Earth's core, atoms, or tiny particles, of uranium split apart. When the atoms split, they give off lots of heat.Scientist J. Marvin Herndon says the nuclear reaction in the core triggers volcanoes, moves the giant plates of rock that make up Earth's surface, and causes a magnetic field to surround our planet.Earth has a magnetic field similar to a magnet's. Just like a magnet, Earth has a north pole and a south pole. The north pole has a positive magnetic charge; the south pole has a negative charge.Earth's magnetic field changes over time. Over long periods of time, the magnetic poles move around. Sometimes the magnetic field completely disappears.Herndon says the nuclear reaction at Earth's core causes those changes. He says the nuclear reaction changes. Sometimes it gives off lots of energy. At other times, it gives off less energy. And sometimes it stops for a short time.If there is a nuclear reactor in Earth's core, someday it will stop completely. That would cause volcanoes to stop erupting, Earth's plates to stop moving, and the magnetic field to disappear forever.The magnetic field protects Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. If the field disappears, life on Earth would end. But don't worry about that. The nuclear reaction in the core will not stop for 2 billion years, Herndon says.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.
2	"Kids who live in the United States are changing, according to the U.S. census. Sure, kids are getting taller, stronger, and faster as they grow up. But they are changing in another way, too--U.S. kids are more, or different in background, than ever before.The graph shows percentages of people living in the U.S. from some ethnic groups. The figures add up to more than 100% because some people said they were from more than one ethnic group and were counted more than once.Every ten years, the U.S. government counts all the people who live in the United States. The count is called the. Recently, the government began releasing some of the information it learned from the 2000 census.The census counted 281.4 million people in the United States. More than 72 million of those people are kids under age 18. That means that about 26 out of every 100 people are kids!The census also showed that U.S. kids are morediverse than ever before. That means that today's kids have ancestors who came from a greater variety of foreign countries. ""The nation is more diverse in the year 2000 than it was in 1990, when the last census was taken,"" said Jorge del Pinal of the U.S. Census Bureau., or people who are not part of the largest ethnic group, increased from 24 percent to 31 percent of the total U.S. population. Much of that minority increase is due to immigration to the United States, the census reported. One in five kids has at least one parent who moved to this country from another country.Del Pinal added that kids are more diverse than their parents because the number of marriages between people of different races is four times higher than it was in 1990. Two out of every five kids are part of at least one minority group.Nearly 3 million kids have parents who have different ethnic backgrounds. For example, one parent may be from Asia and another from Europe.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

4	Metals are extracted from ores. An ore is a rock that contains enough of a mineral (metal compound) for the metal to be extracted from it. Most metals are extracted from an ore by reduction with carbon or by electrolysis.Metals such as zinc, iron and copper are present in ores as their. Each of these oxides is heated with carbon to obtain the metal.iron oxide + carbon → iron + carbon dioxide(s) + 3C(s) → 4Fe(l) + 3COThe source of carbon for this reduction is, obtained by heating coal in the absence of oxygen. Note that the iron iswhen it is formed, due to the very high temperature at which the reaction takes place.Some metals, such as aluminium, are sothat their oxides cannot be reduced by carbon.. For example, copper(II) chloride contains positively charged copper ions and negatively charged chloride ions. Ionic substances can beinto the elements they are made from by electricity, in a process calledFor electrolysis to work, the ions must be, the ions break free from the ionic lattice. These ions are then free to move.For example, if electricity is passed through copper(II) chloride solution, the copper(II) chloride is broken down to form copper metal and chlorine gas.There is a similar result if electricity is passed through molten copper(II) chloride.The solution or molten ionic compound is called an. The negative electrode is called the, while the positive electrode is called thePositively charged ions move to the negative electrode. Metal ions are positively charged, so metals are produced at the negative electrode (cathode).Negatively charged ions move to the positive electrode. Non-metal ions, such as oxide ions and chloride ions, are negatively charged, so gases such as oxygen or chlorine are produced at the positive electrode (anode).metal on Earth. Despite this, it is, largely because of the amount of. The bauxite is purified to yield a white powder, aluminium oxide, from which aluminium can be extracted.. But first the aluminium oxide must be madeso that electricity can pass through it. Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point (over 2,000°C), so it would be expensive to melt it. Instead, it is, an aluminium compound with a lower melting point than aluminium oxide. The use of cryolite reduces some of the energy costs involved in extracting aluminium.The diagram shows an aluminium oxide electrolysis tank. Both the negative electrode (cathode) and positive electrode (anode) are made offorms at the negative electrode and sinks to the bottom of the tank, where it is tapped off.forms at the positive electrodes. This oxygen reacts with the carbon of the positive electrodes, forming carbon dioxide, and they gradually burn away. Consequently, the positive electrodes have to be replaced frequently, which adds to the cost of the process.Read on if you are taking theGiven the equation for the extraction of a metal, it is possible to calculate the mass ofWhat mass of iron metal can be made from 5 tonnes of iron(III) oxide?(s) + 3C(s) = 4Fe(l) + 3COC = 12, Fe = 56, O = 16These relative atomic masses can be used to find thehas the formula mass = (2 x 56) + (3 x 16) = 160produces 4Fe.

""Someday I will go to Mars,"" Danny said later.Over the years, many people have dreamed of going to Mars. The day when travel to Mars is possible is coming closer. Robot spacecraft have already traveled there. Those spacecraft have made many amazing discoveries.The most recent spacecraft to journey to the fourth rock from the sun is. It started orbiting the red planet more than a year ago.Recent photos taken by Mars Odyssey show that Mars has water. Because it is very cold on Mars, the water is frozen. Most of the water is frozen under the surface of Mars.Even though lots of ice crystals are mixed in with the Martian soil, Mars doesn't have as much water as Earth has. Mars has lakes of water, not oceans of water. In fact, scientists say that if you collected all the water on Mars, it would fill a lake about twice the size of Lake Michigan.There is evidence that some of the frozen water locked under the surface of Mars might melt every once in a while. Some of the water is only 18 inches below the surface. Molten rock deep beneath the surface of Mars might heat the ice. The melted ice might mix with salt deposits in the Martian soil and flow down steep canyon walls.- a vehicle that flies through space-a device that makes objects look closer than they areshow long, dark streaks on the walls of some canyons. The streaks might indicate areas where water recently flowed down the canyon walls.Not all scientists agree, however. Many scientists say wind blowing across Mars caused the streaks. Scientists have long known about powerful wind storms on Mars. Some of those storms blow across the surface for months at a time.Even if liquid water and life do not exist on Mars today, many scientists agree with Danny. They want to explore the red planet.""I'm interested in Mars because it's probably the most fascinating planet in the solar system besides Earth, and probably the only one that could have ever supported other forms of life,"" said one NASA scientist.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

4	The alkali metals, halogens and noble gases are three important groups in the periodic table.The alkali metals are soft, reactive metals. They react vigorously with water and become more reactive as you go down the group.The halogens are reactive non-metals. They become darker as you go down the group. Their reactivity decreases as you go down the group and their boiling points increase. A more reactive halogen will displace a less reactive halogen from solutions of its salts.The noble gases are unreactive non-metals, which exist as single atoms.The elements in group 1 are called the alkali metals. They belong to the left-hand column in the periodic table. They are very reactive and must be stored in oil to avoid contact with air or water.The alkali metals have the following properties in common:they have low melting and boiling points compared to most other metalsthey are very soft and can be cut easily with a knifethey have low densities (lithium, sodium and potassium will float on water)they react quickly with water, producing hydroxides and hydrogen gastheir hydroxides and oxides dissolve in water to form alkaline solutionsThe alkali metals - trends in reactivityAs you go down the group, the atomic number of the alkali metals increases, and their properties change:You will probably see lithium, sodium and potassium at school, but rubidium and caesium are considered to be too reactive to use in the classroom. Francium is radioactive and very rare - there are only a few grams of it in the whole of the Earth's crust at any time.Reactions of lithium, sodium and potassium with waterThe hydroxides formed in all these reactions dissolve in the water to form alkaline solutions. These turn universal indicator purple - showing that the pH is more than 7.The elements in group 7 are called the halogens. They belong to the column second from right in the periodic table. The halogens are all toxic, but this is a useful property. Chlorine is used to sterilise drinking water and water in swimming pools. Iodine is used in antiseptics to treat wounds.The halogens have the following properties in common:they have low melting and boiling pointsthey are poor conductors of heat and electricitytheir molecules each contain two atoms (they are diatomic)The halogens - trends in physical propertiesThe halogens have low melting points and boiling points. This is a typical property of non-metals. You can see from the graph that fluorine, at the top of Group 7, has the lowest melting point and boiling point in the Group. The melting points and boiling points then increase as you go down the Group.Melting and boiling points of Group 7 elementsRoom temperature is usually about 20°C. At this temperature, fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine and astatine are solids. You should remember this trend down the periodic table - the top two elements are gases, the bottom two are solids and the middle element is liquid.The halogens become darker as you go down the group. Fluorine is very pale yellow, chlorine is yellow-green and bromine is red-brown. Iodine crystals are shiny purple-black but easily turn into a dark purpleVapour is a cloud of liquid particles. Steam is water vapour.You need to be able to explain what happens in halogen displacement reactions. A more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive halogen from its salt dissolved in water. Here's an example:Chlorine is more reactive than bromine (you know this because chlorine is above bromine in group 7). Sodium bromide is a salt of bromine that will dissolve in water. So chlorine will displace bromine from sodium bromide solution.This means that if chlorine (as a gas or dissolved in water) is added to sodium bromide solution, bromine forms and the mixture turns brown. We say that bromine has been displaced from sodium bromide. Displaced is just a chemist's word for pushed out. Here are the equations for the reaction:chlorine + sodium bromide    →    sodium chloride + bromineYou can see that the Cl and Br have swapped places. If you test different combinations of the halogens and their salts you can work out a reactivity series for the halogens. The most reactive halogen displaces all the other halogens from solutions of their salts, while the least reactive halogen is always displaced. It works just the same whether you use a sodium salt or a potassium salt.The simulation shows what happens when chlorine, bromine and iodine are added to various halogen salts. Note carefully what products are present in the test tube after each reaction.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

They belong to the right-hand column in the periodic table. The noble gases are all chemically unreactive which means they areThe noble gases have the following properties in common:they exist as single atoms (they are monatomic)The main uses of the noble gasesUsed in balloons and airships. It is much less dense than air, so balloons filled with it float upwards.Used in advertising signs. It glows when electricity is passed through it, and different coloured 'neon lights' can be made by coating the inside of the glass tubing with other chemicals.Used in light bulbs. The very thin metal filament inside the bulb would react with oxygen and burn away if the bulb were filled with air instead of argon. As argon is unreactive, it stops the filament burning away.The noble gases - trends in physical propertiesThe noble gases all have low boiling points. This is a typical property of non-metals. You can see from the graph that helium, at the top of group 0, has the lowest boiling point in the group. The boiling points then increase as you go down the group.Boiling points of the Group 0 elementsThe density of a substance is a measure of how heavy it is for its size. For example, a small lump of a very dense substance such as gold or lead has a high mass. The particles in gases are spread far apart, so gases have low densities. You can see from the graph that helium, at the top of group 0, has the lowest density in the group. The densities then increase as you go down the group. Radon, at the bottom of the group, is the densest gas known (1 g/dm

It was not easy to build a town on the swampy land, but the colonists refused to give up.This year marks the 400th anniversary of Jamestown's beginning. Thousands of people are expected to attend events at Jamestown to learn about the first permanent English settlement in North America.Visitors will have a chance to travel back in time. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of the world of Jamestown in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson toldHe helped create the exhibits at the settlement site. The exhibits give visitors a look ator human-made objects. Those artifacts include tools, clothing, and weapons.The settlers built a small, triangle-shaped fort so their homes would be protected. ""There were hundreds of people living very close together,"" Davidson explained. The small settlement at Jamestown grew to become the first of the 13 colonies. Those colonies later became the United States.A powerful Native American group called the Powhatan lived on the land when the English colonists settled Jamestown. At first, the Powhatan leader was friendly, but soon the two groups began fighting. They made peace in 1614 when Pocahontas married an Englishman. She was the daughter of Chief Powhatan. Pocahontas went to England, where her portrait was painted. The peace did not last, though.

3	is a category within the classification system. Living things of the same type belong to the same species. For example, humans are one species and dogs are another species.Individuals of the same species can reproduce to make more individuals of the same species. Two individuals belonging to different species cannot normally reproduce together. If they do, their offspring is usually infertile and unable to reproduce.For example animals called ligers are produced when a male lion and a female tiger reproduce. But a liger cannot have offspring. This means that lions and tigers are different species.All people are human. They belong to the same species. Your friends and classmates may have different eye colour and hair colour. Some will be boys and some will be girls. Some will be tall and some will be shorter. The presence of differences between living things of the same species is called variation.Variation between different species is always greater than the variation within a species.More than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

4	In this section, we will look at resistance (measured in ohms) and how it is calculated in different types of circuit. We will look at how the resistance in the filament of a lamp changes when the filament heats up. You will also learn about diodes, heat-dependent resistors (called thermistors) and light-dependent resistors (LDRs).An electric current flows when charged particles called electrons move through a conductor. The moving electrons can collide with theAll elements are made of atoms. An atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons.An electrical conductor is a material which allows an electrical current to pass through it easily. It has a low resistance. A thermal conductor allows thermal energy to be transferred through it easily.. This is called resistance and it makes it harder for current to flow. These collisions make the conductor hot. It is this that makes a lamp filament hot enough to glow.. The greater the number of ohms, the greater the resistance.The equation below shows the relationship between resistance, voltage, current:) = volts (V) / amperes (A)The current flowing through a resistor at a constant temperature is directly proportional to the voltage across the resistor. So, if you double the voltage, the current also doubles. This is called Ohm’s Law. The graph shows what happens to the current and voltage when a resistor follows Ohm’s Law.Bicycles with battery operated lights often have different size bulbs for the front and rear lights. The filament in the front lamp has a resistance of 3 ohms. It takes a current of 0.6A. What voltage does it work at?The answer is 1.8V. If you didn't get the correct answer make sure you have used the formula correctly.So the voltage in the lamp is 3 x 0.6 = 1.8 voltsYou should know how to change theThe opposition in an electrical component to the flow of electricity through it. Resistance is measured in ohms.in a circuit and how to work out the resistance in a series circuit.You will not need to worry about the resistance of the wires joining the circuit together. In most circuits, the resistance of the connecting wires is so small that it can be ignored.When components are connected in series, their total resistance is the sum of their individual resistances. For example, if a 2resistor are connected side by side, their total resistance is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6If you increase the number of lamps in a series circuit, the total resistance will increase and less current will flow.

Resistance is measured in ohms.Thermistors are used as temperature sensors, for example, in fire alarms. Their resistance decreases as the temperature increases:At low temperatures, the resistance of a thermistor is high and little current can flow through them.At high temperatures, the resistance of a thermistor is low and more current can flow through them.LDRs (light-dependent resistors) are used to detect light levels, for example, in automatic security lights. Their resistance decreases as the light intensity increases:In the dark and at low light levels, the resistance of an LDR is high and little current can flow through it.In bright light, the resistance of an LDR is low and more current can flow through it.

The ivory-billed woodpecker, that's who!For more than 50 years, scientists thought the ivory-billed woodpecker was extinct in the United States. Now bird lovers are flying high. Scientists recently announced that they have evidence the bird still exists in eastern Arkansas. The scientists caught the black-and-white birds in flight on a blurry videotape.The ivory-billed woodpecker was seen again at Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Eastern Arkansas.The rare woodpeckers began to disappear between 1880 and the 1940s when loggers cut down the forests where they lived. The last sighting was in 1944.The ivorybill is the largest woodpecker in the country. The red-crested bird's body is shiny blue-black. It has white markings on its neck and on both edges of its huge wings. The woodpecker's wingspan extends almost 3 feet. The bird also has a straight bill, short legs, and feet with curved claws., or one-of-a-kind, sound. They produce a double knock when their strong beaks strike trees. In addition, they make a call that sounds like the toot of a toy horn.For people who doubted the videotape of the woodpeckers, the scientists collected more proof. They recorded the bird's double knock.The recording made believers out of the doubters. ""Hearing [the recording] was very exciting!"" Richard Prum, a scientist from Yale University who studies birds, told. ""[It is] convincing evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct.""What are people doing to help the number of ivory-billed woodpeckers bounce back? Nature lovers are cutting down some trees in a select area of Arkansas. Sound strange? The woodpeckers feed on young beetles that thrive under the bark of fallen trees.

3	"> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuadeArgue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuadeWhen you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".Want to get your own way?

Remember, there are lots of different ways to perform the same scene. A good answer depends on how well you explain yourself.Here is an example of an answer to a question about performance. Think about how you might answer the same question.How should an actor playing Benvolio behave?Benvolio's replies to Romeo could either show that he is a good listener who wants to understand his friend's problems, or that he is amused by what Romeo has to say because he knows that his friend is not serious about this girl.When Benvolio speaks to Montague, the mood is serious. When Romeo arrives, he has to ask lots of questions because Romeo is evasive. Some of Benvolio's comments could be said in a sarcastic or sympathetic way. The jokes that the two characters share show that they are good friends. Benvolio gives advice at the end of the scene that shows that he doesn't believe Romeo's love for Rosaline is serious.The way Benvolio behaves towards Romeo shapes the way the audience perceives Romeo. This is important because Romeo is the main character. The audience has to like him and worry about him for the tragedy to work. If the actor playing Benvolio speaks his lines in a patient and sympathetic way, it makes Romeo seem like a young man who finds the world confusing. If Benvolio's lines are spoken humorously, the comedy in Romeo's speeches will be brought to life.Once you understand the First Key Extract, you are ready to move on to the second.More from Romeo and Juliet first key extract:Read the full text online and make your own notes.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

We’ve piled up some well-known titles that have been challenged.Should some books be banned? Why or why not? Write your opinion in a paragraph. Then hold a class debate for or against book banning.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

Their feet are lined with millions of tiny hairs that canon to a surface. To latch is to grab. The new glue is made with millions of tiny plastic fibers. The fibers grab hold as they slide across things. Like gecko feet, the glue releases easily. It doesn't leave a sticky film behind either. Scientist Ron Fearing helped create the glue. He compares it to how a toothbrush works. ""If I tap [a toothbrush] lightly against a surface, a few bristles will make contact,"" he says. ""But if I rub the toothbrush across the surface, the bristles bend and make ... more contact.""

4	Green plants absorb light energy using chlorophyll in their leaves. They use it to react carbon dioxide with water to make a sugar called glucose. The glucose is used in respiration, or converted into starch and stored. Oxygen is produced as a by-product.This process is called photosynthesis. Temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and light intensity are factors that can limit the rate of photosynthesis.Plants also need mineral ions, including nitrate and magnesium, for healthy growth. They suffer from poor growth in conditions where mineral ions are deficient.photosynthesis is the process where green plants use water and carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce carbohydrates (stored energy) and release oxygen (as a by-product).is the chemical change which happens in the leaves of green plants. It is the first step towards making food - not just for plants but ultimately every animal on the planet.Waste product of aerobic exercise that is breathed out through the lungs.and water are converted into glucose andgaseous element making up about 20% of the air, which is needed by living organisms for respiration, which is absorbed by a green substance called chlorophyll.Photosynthesis takes place in leaf cells. These contain chloroplasts, which are tiny objects containing chlorophyll.carbon dioxide + water (+ light energy)'Light energy' is shown in brackets because it is not a substance. You will also see the equation written like this:Plants absorb water through their roots, and carbon dioxide through their leaves. Some glucose is used for respiration, while some is converted into insolublea type of carbohydrate. Plants can turn the glucose produced in photosynthesis into starch for storage, and turn it back into glucose when it is needed for respiration.for storage. The stored starch can later be turned back into glucose and used in respiration. Oxygen is released as a by-product of photosynthesis.Three factors can limit the speed of photosynthesis - light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature.Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly, even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide. Increasing the light intensity will boost the speed of photosynthesis.Sometimes photosynthesis is limited by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. Even if there is plenty of light, a plant cannot photosynthesise if there is insufficient carbon dioxide.If it gets too cold, the rate of photosynthesis will decrease. Plants cannot photosynthesise if it gets too hot.If you plot the rate of photosynthesis against the levels of these three limiting factors, you get graphs like the ones above.In practice, any one of these factors could limit the rate of photosynthesis.Farmers can use their knowledge of these limiting factors to increase crop growth in greenhouses. They may use artificial light so that photosynthesis can continue beyond daylight hours, or in a higher-than-normal light intensity. The use of paraffin lamps inside a greenhouse increases the rate of photosynthesis because the burning paraffin produces carbon dioxide, and heat too.Plants need to take in a number of elements to stay alive. The most important are:Plants get hydrogen and oxygen from water in the soil, and carbon and oxygen from carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere. Water and carbon dioxide are used to synthesise food during photosynthesis. Oxygen is used to release energy from food during respiration.In addition to these three elements, plants need a number of minerals for healthy growth. These are absorbed through the roots as mineral ions dissolved in the soil water. Two important mineral ions needed by plants are:- for making amino acids, which are needed to make proteinsIf a plant does not get enough minerals, its growth will be poor. It will suffer from deficiency symptoms:deficient in nitrate - it will suffer from stunted growthdeficient in magnesium - it's leaves will turn yellowThe tomato plant on the left is healthy, the one on the right is growing in conditions where mineral ions are deficient

4	Cells depend on the body environment to live and function. Homeostasis keeps the body environment under control and keeps the conditions right for cells to live and function. Without the right body conditions, certain processes (eg osmosis) and proteins (eg enzymes) will not function properly.Living cells depend on the movement of chemicals around the body. Chemicals such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and dissolved food need to be transported into and out of cells. This is done by the processes of diffusion and osmosis, and these processes depend on the body's water and salt balance, which are maintained by homeostasis.Cells depend on enzymes to speed up the many chemical reactions that keep the cell alive and make it do its job. These enzymes work best at particular temperatures, and so again homeostasis is vital to cells as it maintains a constant body temperature.Particles in liquids and gases move about randomly in all directions.In an area of high concentration, particles will escape from the concentrated area to places where there are fewer or no particles. Very few particles leave an area of low concentration to go to an area where the concentration is higher.is the movement of particles from an area ofconcentration.

The oxygen diffuses across the alveolar walls into the blood.

Make sure you know an example from plants as well as from animals.Some membranes in plant and animal cells allow certain particles to pass through them but not others. They areDuring osmosis, more water molecules pass from the pure water into the dilute solution than pass back the other way. This is because there is a higher concentration of water molecules in the pure water than in the solution. This results in more water molecules diffusing across the concentration gradient from the water to the solution. Eventually, the level on the more concentrated side of the membrane will rise, while that on the less concentrated side falls.. This is still like diffusion, as the water is moving from a higher concentration of water to a lower concentration of water.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

At this point, the net exchange of water is zero, and the system is inIf red blood cells are placed in pure water, water enters them by osmosis and the red blood cells swell up and burst.If cells are placed in a concentrated solution, water leaves them by osmosis and they are unable to function.. This is why homeostasis is important - to keep our body temperature at aAs the temperature increases, so does the rate of chemical reaction. This is because heat energy causes more collisions, with more energy, between the enzyme molecules and other molecules.

4	Why do scientists think that light and sound are waves?Light travels as transverse waves and can travel through a vacuum. Sound travels as longitudinal waves and needs to travel through a solid, liquid or gas: it cannot travel through a vacuum.Light and sound can be reflected and refracted, just like water waves. Light and sound can also be diffracted, just like water waves, but diffraction in light is less obvious than in sound.Light and sound both travel as waves, but they are not identical. The table summarises the similarities and differences between them.Waves in which the vibrations happen at right-angles to the direction of travel. Light travels as transverse waves.Waves in which the vibrations happen in the same direction as the direction of travel.

However, each tiny bit of the surface still follows the rule that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.when they pass across the boundary between two substances with different densities, such as air and glass. This causes them toThere is one special case you need to know. Refraction doesn't happen if they cross the boundary at an angle of 90° - in that case they carry straight on.Remember that sound and light waves behave just like water waves in a ripple tank. The bending follows a regular pattern. Check your understanding of refraction by having a go at the animation.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment. For information on how to enable JavaScript please go to theYou will not be able to see this content until you have JavaScript switched on.You should be able to describe a use of total internal reflection with the help of a diagram.Waves going from a dense medium to a less dense medium speed up at the boundary. This causes light rays to bend when they pass from glass to air at an angle other than 90º. This is refraction., all the waves reflect back into the glass. We say that they are totally internally reflected. Have a go at the animation to check your understanding of this.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment. For information on how to enable JavaScript please go to theYou will not be able to see this content until you have JavaScript switched on.All light waves, which hit the surface beyond this critical angle, are effectively trapped. The critical angle for most glass is about 42 °.An optical fibre is a thin rod of high-quality glass. Very little light is absorbed by the glass. Light getting in at one end undergoes repeated total internal reflection, even when the fibre is bent, and emerges at the other end.Optical fibres are used in endoscopes that allow surgeons to see inside their patients.Optical fibres can also carry enormous amounts of information as pulses of light.When waves meet a gap in a barrier, they carry on through the gap. However, the waves spread out to some extent into the area beyond the gap. This isYou should know that the amount of diffraction depends on theThe length of a single wave, measured from one wave crest to the next.The extent of the spreading depends on theof the waves. The smaller the width of the gap compared with the wavelength of the wave, the stronger the diffraction. For example, when waves spread into a harbour, they spread out more if the harbour mouth is narrow.Sound can diffract through a doorway or around buildings. Lower pitched sounds travel better than high-pitched sounds. This is because low-pitched sounds have a long wavelength compared with the width of the gap, so they spread out more.Ultrasound is sound with a high frequency. It has a very short wavelength compared with most gaps, so there is very little spreading. This makes sharp focusing of ultrasound easier, which is good for medical scanning.Light has a very short wavelength compared with most everyday gaps such as windows and doors. There is little obvious diffraction, so it produces sharp shadows.Long wave radio signals are much less affected by buildings and tunnels than short wave radio signals or VHF radio signals. Because of diffraction, radio signals can sometimes be received in the shadow of hills.Where two waves meet, their effects are added together. This is calledWhen they arrive in step, they reinforce each other to give a wave of greaterThe maximum height of a wave, measured from the mid-point of its vibration.When they arrive out of step, they cancel out.If a laser is shone on two slits very close together, the diffracted beam can be seen on a screen to have bright and dark bands on it.The bright bands show constructive interference of light.The dark bands show destructive interference of light.Interference and diffraction of light and sound show that light and sound are both types of wave.

4	Scatter diagrams are used to represent and comparesets of data. By looking at a scatter diagram, we can see whether there is any connection () between the two sets of data.Matt sells ice-creams at outdoor events. He often buys too much or too little ice-cream from the wholesalers, so does not make as much profit as he would like. He decides to record how many ice-creams he sells over a number of days, to see whether there is a link between the temperature and number of ice-creams sold. Here are his results:There appears to be a connection. When the temperature is low, the number of ice-creams sold is also low. When the temperature is high, the number of ice-creams sold is high.But it is much easier to judge the results by looking at aPlotting a scatter diagram is easy. The results are in pairs, so it is just like plotting coordinates.The axes have been drawn so that the temperature is on the horizontal axis and number of ice-creams sold on the vertical. We therefore plot the points (21, 70), (26, 86), (15, 50) etc.Did you notice the jagged lines close to the origin?A broken scale is used when values close to 0 are not required. In this case, we only needed to start the horizontal axis at 15, and the vertical axis at 50.Care must be taken to use the broken scale appropriately. It is OK to use it in this case, but it can sometimes be misleading.between two sets of data, it means they are connected in some way.We have seen that as the temperature. The results are approximately in a straight line, with a positive gradient. We therefore say that there isLook at the following scatter diagram. It shows the connection between the number of weeks a song has been in the Top 40 and sales of the single for that week.There is a definite a connection between the two sets of data, as the results are approximately in a straight line. As the number of weeks. The line therefore has a negative gradient, and we say there isThe following scatter diagram shows the connection between a person's house number and their IQ (one measure of intelligence).It is obvious that there is no connection between these values, and this is shown by the scatter diagram. We say there isThe 'line of best fit' is a line that goes roughly through the middle of all the scatter points on a graph. The closer the points are to the line of best fit the stronger we can say the correlation is.is drawn so that the points are evenly distributed on either side of the line. There are various methods for drawing this 'precisely', but you will only be expected to draw the line 'by eye'.You may be asked to comment on the nature of the correlation. This means you will be expected to say whether there is positive, negative or no correlation. Using terms such as 'strong', 'moderate' or 'weak' will give a clearer indication of the strength of the connection.When drawing the line of best fit, use a transparent ruler so you can see how the line fits between all the points before you draw it.Look at the following scatter diagram which shows the test results in maths and science for a class of 24 pupils.Is there any correlation between the results?What is the highest mark in maths?The highest mark for maths is 86. There are no marks higher than 86 on the horizontal scale.What is the lowest mark in science?The lowest mark for science is 52.Jane scored 68 for her maths test, what was her mark for science?There is only one result which has an 'x-coordinate' of 68. The 'y-coordinate' of this result is 70, so the science mark is 70.Where on the graph would you draw the line of best fit?Remember that the line of best fit goes through the middle of the distribution of all the points.You can also use a line of best fit to predict results.The heights and weights of 20 children in a class are recorded. The results are shown on the scatter diagram below.Katie is 148cm tall. Estimate her weight.Start by drawing a line of best fit. Remember that the line of best fit is drawn so that the points are evenly distributed on either side of the line.Katie is 148cm tall, so we use the line of best fit to find an approximate weight. Find 148cm on the height axis. Now follow the line up until you hit the line of best fit. Now read across the graph to the weight axis.Katie weighs approximately 52kg. As you are only drawing the line of best fit 'by eye', it is unlikely that your answers will be exactly the same as your friend's. The examiners will take this into account.

4	"The shift from working at home to factories brought with it a new system of working. Factory owners sought to control and discipline their workforce through a system of long working hours, fines and low wages.most people worked in their own homes. They were able to start and stop work when they wanted.(ie they treated it as a holy day, taking the day off to get over their hangovers) and it was said that the looms worked to the rhythm ‘Plenty-o’time’ on Tuesday and Wednesday, and ‘A-day-t’late’ on Thursday and Friday.The new factories ran to the unceasing, unchanging rhythm of the steam engine, and factory ownersIn the past, many historians took their facts about conditions in the factories and mines from two Parliamentary investigations:(1842) – the first report to include pictures and these reports provide the ‘traditional’ view of what it was like to work in a factory.According to this view of factory work, not only men, but women and tiny children did physically monotonous and/or strenuous work in hot, damp, dusty and dangerous conditions for long hours, for next-to-nothing pay, under a regime of cruel overseers, punishments and fines.A cotton factory - a child can be seen sweeping among the moving machineryThis is the kind of information you would get if you read an older textbook such as "", with extra time required during brisk times when trade was good. Workers were often required to clean their machines during their mealtimes. It was claimed that employers changed the clocks to get a few minutes extra out of their workers every day.– a typical wage for male workers was about 15 shillings (75p) a week, but women and children were paid much lower wages, with women earning 7 shillings (35p) and children 3 shillings (15p). For this reason,employers preferred to employ women and children. Many men were sacked when they reached adulthood and had to be supported by their wives and children.– frequent ‘strapping’ (it was claimed that children had been thrashed to death).One witness claimed that he had seen an iron bar driven through the cheek of one girl. Other alleged punishments included hanging iron weights around children’s necks, hanging them from the roof in baskets, nailing a child’s ear to the table, and dowsing them in water butts to keep them awake.– fines were imposed for things like talking or whistling, leaving the room without permission, of having a little dirt on a machine. It was claimed that employers altered the time on the clocks to make their workers late so that they could fine them.Some employers required their overseers to raise a minimum amount each week from fines.– many children who were forced to stand for long hours grew up with conditions such as knock-knees and bow legs.– forcing children to crawl into dangerous, unguarded machinery - often when they were so tired they were falling asleep on their feet - led to many accidents. It was said that 40 per cent of accident cases at Manchester Infirmary in 1833 were factory accidents.– cotton thread had to be spun in damp conditions at 70ºF. Going straight out into the cold night air led to. The air was full of dust, which led to chest and lung diseases and loud noise made by machines damaged workers' hearing.– orphans from workhouses in the south of England were ""apprenticed"" to factory owners, supposedly to learn the textiles trade., and slept in barracks attached to the factory, in the beds just vacated by children about to start the next shift.– some employers paid their workers in tokens, which could only be spent at the employer’s shop, where prices were higher."" as young as four years old sat all day in the dark, opening the doors for the truck to pass through."" pushed tubs and children as young as six carried coal for the hewers.

2	"Thousands of children were separated from their families after Hurricane Katrina battered the Gulf Coast of the United States in August. The following March, nearly seven months after the storm, 4-year-old Cortez Stewart was finally reunited with her mother and five siblings in Texas.Cortez is believed to be the last of 5,192 children reported missing or displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Her reunion with her family was ""a day of celebration and triumph for all children and families separated after the devastation caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,"" says Ernie Allen of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.Cortez’s return ended the largest child-recovery effort in U.S. history. Cortez’s mother, Lisa Stewart, spent months searching for her daughter. Stewart feared that Cortez might not be alive.When the hurricane struck, Cortez and her godmother were rescued by helicopter from a New Orleans hotel. They were eventually taken to Atlanta, Georgia. Lisa Stewart and her five other children were taken to safety by boat from their home. The family ended up in an apartment in Houston, Texas. Investigators had trouble reconnecting the family because of incorrect name spellings and other wrong information.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

Ships use special sensors to locate mines.Within the next few months, that same technology will be used to protect something a lot smaller and slower--manatees.In the winter, West Indian manatees are found in many of the warm, shallow waters around Florida.. A lock is an area of water in a canal enclosed by a set of gates at each end. The gates open to allow a ship to enter. The lock then fills with water to raise the ship or drains water to lower it. A lock allows a ship to move from one elevation to another.Canal locks, however, can be deadly traps for manatees. An average of ten manatees a year have been killed in the gates in the past decade.A little more than a year ago, the canal lock at Port Canaveral, Florida, was fitted with sensors like those used by the U.S. Navy to detect underwater mines.The sensors work using sound waves, said Larry Taylor, the engineer overseeing the project. ""When the canal lock sensors [detect] a manatee, they stop the doors from closing,"" said Taylor.Within a few weeks after the Port Canaveral installation, the sensors had saved seven manatees, Taylor said. He said there are plans to install the sensors at seven more Florida canal locks.

4	Morphine is a powerful painkilling drug that acts directly on the central nervous system. It is called an opiate because it comes from the opium poppy. It is prescribed to relieve severe chronic pain, such as cancer pain, and after severe injury or surgery. Morphine has side effects such as drowsiness and blurred vision, and it is very addictive.Heroin is manufactured from morphine and is even more dangerously addictive. But it is useful to treat severe pain in terminally ill patients, and it causes fewer unpleasant side effects than morphine. Both substances are used illegally as recreational drugs, and this is very dangerous.Cannabis is an illegal drug that can be smoked, producing feelings of well-being. But like tobacco it can cause lung cancer and bronchitis. Unlike tobacco, it can cause permanent damage to the mental health of its users. Research has shown that cannabis has some useful painkilling properties, but it is illegal to prescribe it for this use.All drugs have the potential to damage our health, because they change chemical processes in the body. Addictive recreational drugs may damage our health indirectly by reducing the amount of money available to buy food, and by placing users in dangerous situations. Injecting any drug with a needle and syringe that someone else has used may lead to a number of diseases from infected blood, including HIV and hepatitis. Users of illegal drugs may turn to crime to pay for their habit, and this affects the lives of other people.A research report in 2006 classified various drugs according to their health and social risks, without reference to whether they are legal or not. In the report, heroin and cocaine are the most dangerous two drugs, alcohol is the fifth most dangerous and tobacco is ninth.Losing your way?

4	This section will help you revise the way that musical production has changed over the centuries - from the development of the orchestra, to the impact of music technology on the pop song.Below is a checklist of key points you should know about the main periods in western music history.and describes the enormous cultural awakening that blossomed within the arts, sciences and letters throughout Europe at this time.New instruments were invented such as the viola and the violin.Some important composers of the time were: Giovani da Palestrina, Andrea Gabrielli, Josquin Desperez and Johannes OckeghemThis period is named after the ornate architecture that was popular at that time.Composers experimented with the ability of music to express human emotion and depict natural phenomenon. Vivaldi'sThe string and woodwind sections of the orchestra were established, and a keyboard continuo part (usually played on a harpsichord) was added.A stringed instrument used primarily in the Baroque period.A new musical genre was created called Opera: composers were seeking to re-create the drama of the ancient Greeks by fusing poetry, theatre, visual arts and music. The first big opera,by Claudio Monteverdi, was performed in 1607.Some important composers of the period were: Claudio Monteverdi, Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi and George Friedrich Handel.The Classical era was so named because artists, musicians and writers looked towards the clean, uncluttered elegance of the art and philosophy of classical Greece.Harmony was simpler than in the Baroque era. Alberti bass parts were sometimes used (simple broken chords). Melodies were simple and uncomplicated.Some important composers of the time were: Franz Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig Van Beethoven and Christoph Von Gluck.The Romantics were probably the first artists in history to apply a generic name to themselves. The name harks back to the mediaeval romance: poems of chivalry, unattainable love, and distant, enchanted places.The percussion section was expanded to include cymbals and side drumThe brass family developed at this time. Trumpets and horns now had valves and keys, so they could produce more notes, and trombones, previously only used in church music and operas, were added to the orchestra.Nationalism was a major cultural force, and many composers (especially in Russia and eastern Europe) sought to create a national music by importing folk music, dance, poetry and prose into their works.Some important composers of the time were: Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Giuesseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner.Advances in music technology became increasingly important, with new methods of recording, electronic instruments, and the use of computers having a major influence on modern music.New genres emerged alongside the classical forms of 20th-Century art music: blues, jazz, rock 'n roll, and electronic music.Some important composers of the period were: Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Gustav Mahler, John Cage and Phillip Glass.The percussion section was expanded even further to include xylophone, marimba, and various other percussion.Get some direction with a Bitesize revision mapFind out more about making music and send us your performances.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

Genetic and lifestyle factors can lead to the coronary arteries becoming blocked, and an increased risk of heart disease.Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body’sBasic unit of life. Unicellular organisms only have one cell. Multicellular organisms have many cells., and waste products away from them. The circulatory system consists of:the heart, which is the muscular pump that keeps the blood movingthe arteries, which carry blood away from the heartthe veins, which return blood to the heartthe capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that are close to the body’s cellsThe diagram outlines the circulatory system. To make things clear, oxygenated blood is shown in red, and deoxygenated blood in blue.The arteries carry blood from the heart, while veins return blood to it. With both, their structure is related to their function.In order to see this content you need to have bothBlood in the arteries is under high pressure generated by the heart. The arteries have:thick layers of muscle and elastic fibresThe blood in veins is under lower pressure than the blood in arteries. The veins have:thin layers of muscle and elastic fibresUnlike arteries, veins have one-way valves in them to keep the blood moving in the correct direction.The heart is a muscular organ.

It is caused by:genetic factors, which show as a family history of heart diseaseHeart disease is more common in the UK than in non-industrialised countries, and many other industrialised nations. This is due tostress leading to a fast heart ratefrom 2006 about research showing that people with heart disease have arteries which are, biologically, up to 40 years older than they are.A lack of exercise and a diet that is high in salt and saturated fat cause people to:have high levels of cholesterol in their bloodThese factors contribute to an increased risk of heart disease.Epidemiology is the study of factors affecting the health and illness of populations. Doctors and scientists carry out epidemiological studies to try to determine the lifestyle factors that could increase the chances of getting heart disease and other illnesses. When carrying out a study, it would be morally wrong to get people to smoke to find out if smoking causes lung cancer. However, there are people who already smoke and their health can be compared with that of non-smokers.from 2005 about a study from Norway. It showed that smoking just one to four cigarettes a day almost triples the risk of dying from heart disease., researchers examine two groups of people: those with an illness, and those without. They can do this by:following the cohort’s progress over several months or yearsFor example, the health of smokers and non-smokers was followed for many years. It was found that, on average, smokers die ten years earlier.Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to:Give an example of a correlation between a factor and an outcome. For example, wealthier nations have higher levels of heart disease.Suggest factors that might increase the chances of an outcome, but not necessarily determine an outcome. For example, the more cigarettes a person smokes, the more likely they are to develop heart disease. However, some people who smoke never go on to develop heart disease.Explain that individual cases do not provide convincing evidence for or against a correlation. For instance, we might hear someone say, ""Old George smoked 60 cigarettes every day of his life and lived to be 90."" However, we know that ‘Old George’ was just lucky, because smoking 60 cigarettes a day seriously reduces your chances of living into old age. A correlation exists between life expectancy and the number of cigarettes smoked each day.Evaluate how a study is designed by commenting on the sample size and how well the sample is matched. For example, to show that eating fatty foods increases the chances of developing heart disease, we need to compare a large sample size of people who eat fatty food with an equally large sample size of people who do not. The two samples also need to be chosen at random, or matched as closely as possible for other factors such as age, sex, and so on.Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to:Explain why a correlation between a factor and an outcome does not necessarily mean that one causes the other. For example, wealthier nations have higher levels of heart disease. However, this does not mean that wealth is a cause of heart disease, even though a correlation between the two exists. To find the cause, we need to have more scientific data.Use data to show that a factor does, or does not, increase the chances of an outcome. In the examination, this data may be presented in the form of tables or charts.Identify a mechanism that could be abetween a factor and an outcome. For instance, cigarette smoke contains chemicals that, when breathed in, can increase blood pressure and lead to heart damage. The chemicals in the smoke are the mechanism of the causal link.When scientific data has been collected, it is important that this data and any conclusions are reviewed by other scientists. This is called 'peer review'.Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to:Describe the peer review process. For instance, state that other scientists repeat the experiment to see if they get similar results and conclusions.Understand that new scientific claims are less reliable if they have not yet been evaluated by peer review. For example, remarkable claims are being made for 'superfoods', such as that they prevent heart disease and increase longevity. However, many of the claims have not yet been peer reviewed, so they should not be treated as totally reliable.Understand that if the results of an investigation have not been replicated by other scientists, they should be treated with suspicion.Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to explain why scientists think it is important that a claim by one scientist should be replicated by other scientists. This is because the first set of results may contain errors. When scientific research is being paid for by a company with a vested interest, such a food company producing a food that is claimed to lower cholesterol, the results that support the claim need to be examined and replicated to make sure that they are correct."
2	"Florida is the 23rd largest state in the United States. Key West is the southernmost part of the continental United States.Moving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood.President Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades.The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provideBy removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.The maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years.""measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

Today, running is a breeze for him. ""Now I can run 20 laps and I'm not even tired,"" he says.Khalil participates in the Mighty Milers program. That is a running program that helps kids become fit. His school in New York City is one of more than 100 schools in his state to take part in the program. Students run at least half a, several days a week. A mile is 5,280 feet. Students earn prizes and medals depending on how many miles they complete.The goal of Mighty Milers is to reduce childhood. That is the condition of being very overweight. Mighty Milers challenges elementary school kids to run or walk up to fourduring the school year. A marathon is a race that is 26.2 miles.

Usually these take the form of creation accounts in the sacred books of the religions concerned.There are many different stories and beliefs about creation contained in the Hindu scriptures.is believed to be the first sound at the start of creation. Hindus believe that(the one ultimate reality) has three functions and these are shown by the three gods, Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu. These three are sometimes shown as three heads merging into one and are known as the Trimurti.is the Preserver and responsible for keeping all good things on earthand is needed because some things are(a Hindu sacred text.) creation is described as the(knowledge) one of the accounts says that the creator, as a carpenter builds a house.(the first scripture of Hinduism, containing spiritual and scientific knowledge) it says that the universe was created out of the parts of the body of a single cosmic man Purusha when his body was sacrificed. There the four classes () of Indian society come from his body: theAnother attempt at explaining the creation of the universe is found in the Hymn of Creation in theThen was neither non-existence nor existence: there was no realm of air, no sky beyond it.Death was not then, nor was there anything immortal: no sign was there, the Day’s and Night’s divider.Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this All was indiscriminated chaos. All that existed then was void and formless: by the great power of Warmth was born that One.it says that in the beginning was the Brahman, and through heaven, the earth, and the atmosphere and the three seasons of summer, rains, and harvest he produced theOne of the theories put forward by cosmologists is the. This suggests that about 15,000 million years ago there was a massive explosion. This was the point at which all matter in the universe began; space and time began then too. Over time the universe that we know, and human and animal life, emerged.This theory is generally accepted by scientists as being the best theory they have to explain theIf this theory is true, then it could mean that the universe ‘’ and that it did not emerge as a result of the activity of a creator God.Some people suggest parallels between the process of creation as described in the Hindu sacred texts and the scientific understanding of the universe, especially the Big Bang Theory.Some scientists have suggested that, following the Big Bang, the process of the expansion of the universe will eventually be reversed and at some distant point in the future will start to contract, eventually imploding into a `Big Crunch’. This could lead to another ‘Big Bang’, with a new universe being formed. This presents a picture of the universe as a process ofdescribes Vishnu as creator, sustainer, destroyer and then re-creator of the universe. This process takes place over a vast period of time called a(nearly 9 billion years). The creation, sustaining and destruction of the universe is also told in the stories about Shiva, who is often shown as ‘Lord of the Dance’.The idea that life might have evolved was first mentioned as early as the 4th century CE by, who wrote that God probably only created very simple life forms and that these developed over time.Today we associate evolutionary science with scientists such aswho wrote ‘On the Origin of Species’ in 1859. He argued that life began with very simple cells and later developed into what we see today. He said thatwas one of the major mechanisms driving evolution.Darwin upset many people with his views and even some respected scientists such asargued that the fossils, which were discovered in the ground, had been placed there by God deliberately to fool people.For most Hindus, however, the issues and concerns raised by modern science are not important. Some Hindus are interested in these issues, and study them at a high level, however for the majority they are more focused on theScience and Hinduism represent two contrasting understandings of the universe.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

2	"Report Points to Mice As Asthma Cause17 million Americans suffer from asthma. About 5 million kids suffer from asthma.Each year, more than 3 million kids visit the doctor's office because of asthma attacks.When you run hard and play hard, you may have trouble catching your breath. Some kids, however, lose their breath even when they're not running or playing. Those kids have, a disease that makes it hard to breathe.For many years, scientists have known that cigarette smoke, dog and cat, dust mites, and cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks. Dander is tiny bits of fur and skin. Now scientists have added a new culprit to that list--mouse dander.Scientists studied dust samples from 608 U.S. homes with children ages 4 to 9 who suffered from asthma. The scientists found many things in the dust, including evidence of mice. About 95 percent of the homes had at least one room that had mouse dander.The scientists then tested the kids in each of the homes to see if mouse dander triggered asthma attacks in them. The dander triggered attacks in 18 out of every 100 kids.As a result of those tests, Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins University concluded that mice trigger many asthma attacks. In fact, he said, the ""mouse is second in line [after the cockroach in causing asthma attacks].""Mouse dander was found in many of the houses, even though not all of them had mice. Sometimes, kids tracked dander from mice and other animals into their homes when they came in from outside. Sometimes, the dander was from mice that had been in the home in the past.Daniel, who lives in Clarksville, Maryland, suffers from asthma. Last year, scientists collected and studied dust from his home. The scientists found cat dander in the dust, even though his family didn't own a cat. It was cat dander that was triggering Daniel's asthma attacks, said Daniel's doctor.To keep cat dander out of their home, Daniel and his mother frequently wash the floors, walls, and other surfaces. As a result, Daniel's mother said Daniel hasn't had an asthma attack in the last year.Many kids who suffer from asthma might be able to breathe more easily if they could find ways to keep the dander of mice, cats, and other kinds of animals out of their homes.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

Each fall, millions of monarchs from North America head south. Most fly more than 2,000 miles to forests in Mexico.Volunteers in Mexico look for the monarchs wearing tags. The tags help scientists figure out which butterflies reached Mexico and how far they flew., or at risk of dying out. People are cutting down trees in Mexico where the butterflies spend the winter.""Our goal is to save the monarch migration,"" said butterfly expert Chip Taylor.

3	> Inform, explain and describe - InformingThe key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.More than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

4	The Sun provides a stable source of heat and light energy. Photocells transfer light into electricity, and glass can provide passive heating for buildings. Wind turbines transfer kinetic energy in the wind into electricity.The Sun is a stable source of energy that is transferred to the Earth as light energy and heat energy. We can use this energy.Photocells are devices that transfer light energy directly into electrical energy. They produce DC -- electricity. This is electricity in which the current moves in the same direction all the time.Photocells have no moving parts, and can work in remote locations. For example, they are used to power the lights for some road signs.The output of photocells depends on the surface area that is exposed to light. For a given light intensity, the larger the area, the greater the power output.The Hubble Space Telescope uses photocells to generate the electricity it needs - image courtesy of NASAYou may have seen photocells in pocket calculators. Very large panels of photocells are used to power satellites in orbit around Earth.Photocells produce no power in bad weather, or at night. But sunlight is a renewable energy resource and photocells do not produce polluting waste while they are in use. Here are some other advantages to photocells:they have a long life and are rugged - little maintenance is requiredfor buildings. Sunlight passes through the glass and is absorbed by surfaces in the building. It is transferred into heat energy, which is emitted as infrared radiation. This is reflected back into the building by the glass.Solar panels do not generate electricity - rather they heat up water. They are often located on the roofs of buildings, where they can receive energy from the Sun. The diagram outlines how they work:A pump pushes cold water from the storage tank through pipes in the solar panel. The water is heated by energy from the Sun and returns to the tank. In some systems, a conventional boiler is used to increase the temperature of the water.Solar collectors use mirrors to focus the Sun’s rays onto a small area. In some parts of the world, this idea is used to make simple solar ovens to cook food without using fuel. More complex solar collectors useto reflect the Sun’s rays onto a focus point. Motors are used so that the collector moves to track the position of the Sun in the sky.Wind is produced as a result of giant convection currents in the Earth's atmosphere, which are driven by heat energy from the Sun. This means the kinetic energy in wind is a renewable energy resource: so long as the Sun exists, wind will too.Wind turbines have huge blades mounted on a tall tower. The blades are connected to a nacelle, or housing, that contains gears linked to a generator. As the wind blows, it transfers some of its kinetic energy to the blades, which turn and drive the generator.Several wind turbines may be grouped together in windy locations to formPhotocells consist of two types of silicon crystal. When light energy is absorbed by the silicon:negatively charged electrons are knocked loose from the silicon atomsthe electrons flow freely, creating an electric currentPositive 'holes' are also formed, which move in the opposite direction to the electronsThe power output of a photocell increases as:Some advantages and disadvantages of wind turbinesuses a renewable energy resource - windthe amount of electricity generated depends on the wind speedthey may need a lot of space
4	The heat energy for power stations comes from a variety of sources. Some of these are non-renewable, such as oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear fuels. Others are renewable, such as wood and straw.The cost of electricity depends on the power rating of the appliance used, how long it is used for, and the price of a unit of electricity.Power is a measure of how quickly energy is transferred. You can work out power using this equation:power (watt, W) = voltage (volt, V) × current (ampere, A)What is the power if the voltage is 12V and the current is 5A?Check your understanding of this by trying the following activity:Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment. For information on how to enable JavaScript please go to theYou will not be able to see this content until you have JavaScript switched on.You should be able to calculate the cost of using an electrical appliance when given enough information about it.transferred to an appliance depends on its power and the length of time it is switched on. The amount of mains electrical energy transferred is measured in kilowatt-hours, kWh. One unit is 1kWh.The equation below shows the relationship between energy transferred, power and time:energy transferred (kWh) = power (kW) × time (h)Note that power is measured in kilowatts here instead of the more usual watts. To convert from W to kW you must divide by 1000.For example, 2000W = 2000 ÷ 1000 = 2kW.Also note that time is measured in hours here, instead of the more usual seconds. To convert from seconds to hours you must divide by 3600.For example, 1800s = 1800 ÷ 3600 = 0.5 hours.Electricity meters measure the number of units of electricity (the number of kWh) used in a home or other building. The more units used, the greater the cost. The cost of the electricity used is calculated using this equation:total cost = number of units × cost per unitFor example, if 5 units of electricity are used at a cost of 8p per unit, the total cost will be 5 × 8 = 40p.Check your understanding of working out the cost of electricity by having a go at this activity.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

Renewablefuels may also be used, including wood, straw or manure (which generates methane gas as it rots).Nuclear reactors use the heat from nuclear reactions in the nuclear fuel to boil water. Just as in conventional power stations, the steam from the boiling water makes a turbine spin, which in turn makes the generator turn.Unlike conventional power stations, however, nuclear power stations do not release carbon dioxide, so they do not contribute to global warming while in use.and uranium oxide are often used as nuclear fuels. Their supplies are limited, so they are a non-renewable resource.in the reactor itself is prevented from escaping by steel and thick concrete walls. This is important because radiation can cause cancer. The waste from nuclear power stations is radioactive, so it can be harmful, too.is a waste product from nuclear reactors. It can be used to make nuclear bombs.from 2006 about the arguments for and against nuclear power.Power stations fuelled by fossil fuels or nuclear fuels are reliable sources of energy. This means they can provide power whenever it is needed. However, their start-up times vary according to the type of fuel used.Nuclear power stations and coal-fired power stations usually provide ‘base load’ electricity - they are run all of the time because they take the longest time to start up. Oil-fired and gas-fired power stations are often used to provide extra electricity at peak times, because they take the least time to start up.The fuel for nuclear power stations is relatively cheap, but the power stations themselves are expensive to build. It is also very expensive to dismantle old nuclear power stations, and to store their radioactive waste, which is a dangerous health hazard.Renewable fuel resources do not cost anything, but the equipment used to generate the power may be expensive to build. Certain resources are reliable, including tidal barrages and hydroelectric power. Others are less reliable, including wind and solar energy.

3	> Formal and informal writing - Formal LanguageFormal and informal writing - Formal LanguageUsing formal language doesn't mean that you have to sound boring, you can still use words imaginatively in formal writing. News reports use formal language, but the words are rich and stimulating to keep the audience interested.Q1. The two sentences below both use formal language to give us the same information. Which sentence do you think is best and why?a) The bomb broke the windows of nearby buildings.b) The blast shattered the windows of nearby buildings.Q2. Which of the following should NOT use formal language?b) A letter to the local paperc) A speech to teachers or parentsd) A newspaper article aimed at adultsA1. Sentence b is better. Blast and shattered are far more descriptive than bomb and broke.A2. Example a) should not be written with formal language. You wouldn’t use formal language when writing to a close friend.Tips for making your writing more formalMake your writing clear and to the point.Include some complex sentences in your writing. Try using semi-colons if you feel confident about using them correctly.It's good to use figurative language if you think it fits in with the purpose and audience of the task. Metaphors and similes work well in speeches.Don't use 'Well' or 'You know' or 'Anyway' or 'Like I just said' or any phrase that sounds like you are having a friendly chat.Avoid using: 'And', 'But', 'Because' or 'So' at the beginning of a sentence.Words like 'nice' and 'a lot' have no power. Try to think of more descriptive words eg 'delicious' or 'endless'.Clichés are colourful phrases that people use all the time in speech. So often, in fact, that they seem worn out and boring in writing. Avoid phrases such as 'pretty as a picture', 'big as a house', 'skinny as a rake'.Join Questionaut's quest to find his friend's hat.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

That's what happened to John Street and his fourth-grade class in Newcastle, Nebraska.The students wanted to learn about the countries of the world. So they sent 25 e-mails to Street's friends. People who got the e-mails were asked to, or send along, the e-mails to someone else. The students asked everyone to send them an e-mail that told their location. They pinpointed each location on a world map.E-mails came from every continent and dozens of countries. Many more people mailed letters to the students.Street said he made one mistake with the project. He didn't include an end date.

They do not work againstultramicroscopic non-cellular organisms that replicate themselves inside the cells of living hosts: it is difficult to develop drugs that kill viruses without also damaging the body’s tissues.A bacterium damaged and distorted by penicillinThe first antibiotic - penicillin - was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. He noticed that some bacteria he had left in a petri dish had been killed by naturally occurring penicillium mould.Since the discovery of penicillin, many other antibiotics have been discovered or developed. Most antibiotics used in medicine have been altered chemically to make them more effective and safer for humans.Bacterial strains can develop resistance to antibiotics. This happens because of natural selection. In a large population ofSingle-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium., there may be some cells that are not affected by the antibiotic. These cells survive and reproduce, producing even more bacteria that are not affected by the antibiotic.MRSA is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. It is very dangerous because it is resistant to most antibiotics. It is important to avoid over-use of antibiotics, so we can slow down, or stop, the development of other strains of resistant bacteria.One simple way to reduce the risk of infection is to maintain personal hygiene and to keep hospitals clean. In the 19th century, Ignaz Semmelweis realised the importance of cleanliness in hospitals. However, although his ideas were successful, they were ignored at the time because people did not know that diseases were caused by pathogens that could be killed.Let's see how you respond to this activity!The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

Parents feared their children would be exposed to a disease called. The disease crippled many people and sometimes caused death.Thanks to Jonas Salk, polio has been almost wiped out worldwide. Salk was a doctor who invented ato prevent the disease. Vaccines are shots or medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.Salk's vaccine was officially declared safe on April 12, 1955. In honor of the 50th anniversary of that event, a new exhibit will open on April 12 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The exhibit is called ""Whatever Happened to Polio?""disease. That means it can be passed easily from person to person. Polio can strike at any age but mainly affects kids.The disease spreads when a virus attacks the nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain that control muscles in the arms, legs, and stomach. It canpeople, causing them to lose movement in different parts of their body.The museum's exhibit will look at the history of polio and the development of the vaccine. Included among the objects to be displayed are the leg braces worn by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who suffered from the disease.""The introduction of a successful polio vaccine in 1955 was one of the most significant events of the 20th century,"" said museum director Brent Glass.Although polio has disappeared from much of the world, it still threatens children in Africa and Southeast Asia.

4	Metals are very useful. Ores are naturally occurring rocks that contain metal or metal compounds in sufficient amounts to make it worthwhile extracting them. For example, iron ore is used to make iron and steel. Copper is easily extracted, but ores rich in copper are becoming more difficult to find. Aluminium and titanium are metals with useful properties, but they are expensive to extract. Most everyday metals are mixtures called alloys.The outer layer of the Earth, on top of the mantle. It is between 6 and 48 kilometres thick and includes the continents and the ocean floor.Substances formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.such as gold, iron oxide and aluminium oxide, but when found in the Earth these are often mixed with other substances. To be useful, the metals have to be extracted from whatever they are mixed with. Ais a rock containing a metal, or a metal compound, in a high enough concentration to make it economic to extract the metal.The method used to extract metals from the ore in which they are found depends on their reactivity. For example, reactive metals such as aluminium are extracted byElectrolysis is the decomposition (separation or break-down) of a compound using an electric current., while a less-reactive metal such as iron may be extracted byReduction is a reaction in which oxygen is removed from a substance. Reduction also means a gain in electrons.Thus the method of extraction of a metal from its ore depends on the metal's position in the reactivity series:Metals - in decreasing order of reactivityNote that gold, because it is so unreactive, is found as the native metal and not as a compound, so it does not need to be chemically separated. However, chemical reactions may be needed to remove other elements that might contaminate the metal.Blast furnace in a modern steel worksIron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such ascontain iron oxide. The oxygen must be removed from the iron oxide to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are calledCarbon is more reactive than iron, so it can push out or displace the iron from iron oxide. Here are the equations for the reaction:iron oxide + carbon    →    iron + carbon dioxide+ 3C    →    4Fe + 3COIn this reaction, the iron oxide is reduced to iron, and the carbon is oxidised to carbon dioxide.In the blast furnace, it is so hot that carbon monoxide can be used to reduce the iron oxide in place of carbon:iron oxide + carbon monoxide    →    iron + carbon dioxide+ 3CO    →    2Fe + 3COThe raw materials for extracting iron and their function in the processburns in air to produce heat, and reacts to form carbon monoxide (needed to reduce the iron oxide)helps to remove acidic impurities from the iron by reacting with them to form molten slagallows the coke to burn, and so produces heat and carbon monoxideLayers of atoms slide over each other when metals are bent or stretchedPure iron is soft and easily shaped. This is because its atoms are arranged in a regular way that lets layers of atoms slide over each other.Pure iron is too soft for many usesIron from the blast furnace is an alloy of about 96 per cent iron with carbon and some other impurities. It is hard, but too brittle for most uses. So, most iron from the blast furnace is converted into steel by removing some of the carbon.Carbon is removed by blowing oxygen into the molten metal. It reacts with the carbon producing carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These escape from the molten metal. Enough oxygen is used to achieve steel with the desired carbon content. Other metals are often added, such as vanadium and chromium.There are many different types of steel, depending on the other elements mixed with the iron. The table summarises the properties of some different steels.A summary of the properties of some different steelsThe properties of a metal are changed by including other elements, such as carbon. A mixture of two or more elements, where at least one element is a metal, is called an alloy. Alloys contain atoms of different sizes, which distort the regular arrangements of atoms. This makes it more difficult for the layers to slide over each other, so alloys are harder than the pure metal.It is more difficult for layers of atoms to slide over each other in alloysCopper, gold and aluminium are too soft for many uses. They are mixed with other metals to make them harder for everyday use. For example:, used in electrical fittings, is 70 per cent copper and 30 per cent zinc., used in jewellery, is 75 per cent gold and 25 per cent copper and other metals., used in aircraft manufacture, is 96 per cent aluminium and 4 per cent copper and other metals.Smart alloys can return to their original shape after being bent. They are useful for spectacle frames and dental braces.You need to know where to find the transition metals in the periodic table. The transition metals are found in the large block between Groups 2 and 3 in the periodic table. Most metals are placed here, including iron, titanium, copper and nickel.The transition metals have these properties in common:than alkali metals such as sodium, they have- but mercury is a liquid at room temperature -and they areDensity is the ratio of mass to volume. It is usually measured in grams per cubic centimetre or grams per cubic decimetre.Copper is a transition metal. It is soft, easily bent and it is a good conductor of electricity. This makes copper useful for electrical wiring., which makes it useful for plumbing.Copper is purified by electrolysis. Electricity is passed through solutions containing copper compounds, such as copper sulfate - sometimes spelt sulphate. Pure copper forms on the negative electrode.

Research is being carried out to find new ways to extract copper from the remaining ores, without harming the environment too much. This research is very important, as traditional mining produces huge open-cast mines, and the remaining ores are low-grade, which means that they contain relatively little copper and produce a lot of waste rock.from 2005 about a huge copper mine in Chile, South America.Block of aluminium metal - image does not show the transparent oxide layerAluminium and titanium are two metals with a low density. This means that they are lightweight for their size. They also have a very thin layer of their oxides on the surface, which stops air and water getting to the metal, so aluminium and titanium resist corrosion. These properties make the two metals very useful.Aluminium is used for aircraft, trains, overhead power cables, saucepans and cooking foil. Titanium is used for fighter aircraft, artificial hip joints and pipes in nuclear power stations.Unlike iron, aluminium and titanium cannot be extracted from their oxides by reduction with carbon:Aluminium is more reactive than carbon, so the reaction does not work.Titanium forms titanium carbide with carbon, which makes the metal brittle.the process needs a lot of electrical energyand a lot of energy. This especially limits the uses of titanium.less energy is needed to produce recycled aluminiumthan to extract aluminium from its ore. Recycling preserves limited resources and requires less energy, so it causes less damage to the environment.

Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.What does this extract show us about the main character?Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract.Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"".

Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters.Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs.Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path. That will help them figure out where to start digging.

On New Year's Day 200 years earlier, 123 of George Washington's slaves had been freed.Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, toldthat Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865.

Blood is taken from about 300,000 horseshoe crabs each year. Scientists say that no horseshoe crabs are killed when the blood is taken. The horseshoe crabs are later returned to theirEfforts are being made to help protect horseshoe crabs. Scientists warn it will take 20 to 30 years to see if the horseshoe crab population has increased.Scientists say horseshoe crabs were around when the dinosaurs lived.

4	Pathogens are microorganisms - such as bacteria and viruses - that cause disease. Bacteria release toxins, and viruses damage our cells. White blood cells can ingest and destroy pathogens. They can produce antibodies to destroy pathogens, and antitoxins to neutralise toxins.In vaccination pathogens are introduced into the body in a weakened form. The process causes the body to produce enough white blood cells to protect itself against the pathogens, while not getting diseased.Antibiotics are effective against bacteria, but not against viruses. Some strains of bacteria are resistant to antibiotics.that cause infectious disease. Bacteria and viruses are the main pathogens.. They come in many shapes and sizes, but even the largest are only 10 micrometres long - 10 millionths of a metre.and, in favourable conditions, can multiply rapidly. Once inside the body, they release poisons or toxins that make us feel ill. Diseases caused by bacteria include:Hepatitis C virus. DNA are enclosed in a protein coat.Single-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium.. They are among the smallest organisms known and consist of a fragment of genetic material inside a protective protein coat., and they damage the cell when they do this. A virus can get inside a cell and, once there, take over and make hundreds of thousands of copies of itself. Eventually the virus copies fill the whole host cell and burst it open. The viruses are then passed out in the bloodstream, the airways, or by other routes.The body has different ways of protecting itself against. This is aimed at stopping the pathogen getting into the body in the first place. The body’s passive immunity system includes the skin,Slimy white protein, which lines the respiratory tract and alimentary canal.Tiny hairs, which line the respiratory tract. They beat continuously to move mucus and dirt up the bronchi and trachea.in the respiratory system, acid in the stomach, andproteins which catalyse or speed up chemical reactions inside our bodiesIf a pathogen still manages to get into the body, the second defence takes over. This is called, and the white blood cells have key functions in this.A white blood cell ingesting disease-causing bacteriaproduce antitoxins that neutralise the toxins released by pathogensIn a written examination, it is easy to get carried away and waffle on about things such as invaders and battles, but stick to the point. Note that:the pathogens are not the disease – they cause the diseasewhite blood cells do not eat the pathogens – they ingest themantibodies and antitoxins are not living things – they are specialised proteinsThere are several different types of white blood cells, each with different functions, but they can be put into two main groups:Phagocytes can easily pass through blood vessel walls into the surrounding tissue and move towardsa type of natural poison produced by an organism, often as a form of protectioningest and absorb the pathogens or toxinsHaving absorbed a pathogen, the phagocytes may also send out chemical messages that help nearby lymphocytes to identify the type of antibody needed to neutralise them.In order to see this content you need to have bothPathogens contain certain chemicals that are foreign to the body and are called antigens. Each lymphocyte carries a specific type of antibody - a protein that has a chemical 'fit' to a certain antigen. When a lymphocyte with the appropriate antibody meets the antigen, the lymphocyte reproduces quickly, and makes many copies of the antibody that neutralises the pathogen.In order to see this content you need to have bothAntibodies neutralise pathogens in a number of ways:they bind to pathogens and damage or destroy themthey coat pathogens, clumping them together so that they are easily ingested by phagocytesthey bind to the pathogens and release chemical signals to attract more phagocytesLymphocytes may also release antitoxins that stick to the appropriate toxin and stop it damaging the body.People can be immunised against a pathogen through vaccination. Different vaccines are needed for differentVaccination involves putting a small amount of an inactive form of a pathogen, or dead pathogen, into the body. Vaccines can contain:live pathogens treated to make them harmlessa type of natural poison produced by an organism, often as a form of protectionThese all act as antigens. When injected into the body, they stimulate white blood cells to produce antibodies against the pathogen.Because the vaccine contains only a weakened or harmless version of a pathogen, the vaccinated person is not in danger of developing disease - although some people may suffer a mild reaction. If the person does get infected by the pathogen later, the required lymphocytes are able to reproduce rapidly and destroy it.In order to see this content you need to have bothVaccines in early childhood can give protection against many serious diseases. Sometimes more than one vaccine is given at a time, like the MMR triple vaccine against mumps, measles and rubella.Sometimes vaccine boosters are needed, because the immune response 'memory' weakens over time. Anti-tetanus injections may need to be repeated every ten years.Single-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium.or stop their growth. They do not work againstultramicroscopic non-cellular organisms that replicate themselves inside the cells of living hosts: it is difficult to develop drugs that kill viruses without also damaging the body’s tissues.A bacterium damaged and distorted by penicillinThe first antibiotic - penicillin - was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. He noticed that some bacteria he had left in a petri dish had been killed by naturally occurring penicillium mould.Since the discovery of penicillin, many other antibiotics have been discovered or developed. Most antibiotics used in medicine have been altered chemically to make them more effective and safer for humans.Bacterial strains can develop resistance to antibiotics. This happens because of natural selection. In a large population ofSingle-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium., there may be some cells that are not affected by the antibiotic. These cells survive and reproduce, producing even more bacteria that are not affected by the antibiotic.MRSA is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. It is very dangerous because it is resistant to most antibiotics. It is important to avoid over-use of antibiotics, so we can slow down, or stop, the development of other strains of resistant bacteria.One simple way to reduce the risk of infection is to maintain personal hygiene and to keep hospitals clean. In the 19th century, Ignaz Semmelweis realised the importance of cleanliness in hospitals. However, although his ideas were successful, they were ignored at the time because people did not know that diseases were caused by pathogens that could be killed.
