Magazine articles and newspaper reports may try to persuade you to agree with them.Are you tired of the daily grind? Sick of working all hours of the day for little reward? Tired of never having enough money to really enjoy yourself?Here's how to spot this type of text:It tries to convince you to do or agree with something.It contains a mix of fact and opinion.It may use repetition, ""soundbites"" and persuasive or emotive language.It often seems to speak directly to the reader.Argument texts should be balanced and fair, and give all sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.Here's an extract from an argument text:Foxhunting is a subject that provokes very strong feelings. Many people believe that it is cruel to hunt a fox with dogs, and totally agree with its ban.Many farmers, and even conservationists, however, have always argued that the fox is a pest, which attacks livestock and must be controlled.Here are some clues to help you identify an argument text:It discusses an issue, considering all points of view.It often uses a formal and impersonal style to seem balanced.It uses connectives to connect points, for example ""however"", ""but"", ""similarly""Find out the difference between fact and fiction.Join Questionaut's quest to find his friend's hat.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

There are many roles you could try in addition to playing the sport, like coaching younger teams to see if teaching may be a hidden talent! Earning a qualification by taking courses and awards may help guide you towards longer-term job prospects.Outside influences and social groupings may mean you take up a certain sport or avoid it altogether. One thing’s certain, we’ve got more leisure time than ever, so why not do something physical with it?Your school can influence you to become a lifelong participant in sport as a player, organiser or official. Schools have to teach PE within the National Curriculum. Within this you will experience a number of. Each has benefits to you and others.Improve your knowledge of the rules.

Can these courses lead to a career in sport?- does your school have a swimming pool, Astroturf pitch, sports hall or tennis courts?- what sports activity does your school have outside of PE lessons?- are they positive? Do they have favourite sports? What if your favourite isn’t the same as theirs?- are you introduced to clubs in the area?Your school's links with local clubs can affect your participationRole models such as David Beckham, Tanni Grey-Thompson and Kelly Holmes have had a huge influence on participation in recent years.Women are now accepted as managers, officials and club directors although this was not always the case.Some sports, such as squash, have declined in popularity whilst women’s football and extreme sports are booming. Media coverage of sport affects participation levels.

This encourages participation.Some people may expect you to conform toAn assumption based only on a general expectation.behaviour. Opportunities for women are increasing, but support is still limited in some areas. Some religions do not encourage women to participate.Some ethnic groups have a particular interest in certain sports. This cultural influence encourages participation.Racist attitudes still make participation uncomfortable for some sportspeople, so they may quit.All sports are available if you can afford them.Sports needing lots of equipment, travel or expensive facilities are not available to those with little money.Peer pressure can encourage or discourage participation.

This can encourage participation, or make it difficult to do your own thing.Leisure time is the time we have when we are not working, taking care of ourselves or completing our family and home duties.It has increased as a result of:Better working conditions - paid holidays have increasedWe can choose what we do in our leisure time. Local authorities and the leisure industry try to influence us to take part in physical activity and sport. Local authorities have targeted certain user groups by offering themA reduction in the usual price of a ticket granted to a special group of customers, eg students, such as special opening times, reduced fees and organised classes- to encourage participation.Facilities are provided for participants of all ages and levels of ability including:Crystal Palace, Bisham Abbey, Lilleshall, Holme Pierrepoint, Plas-y-Breninalso provide stadiums, playing areas and leisure clubs.Golf courses can be run by the council or privately ownedThe provision of facilities is always based upon:Location – is it in the right place? Can permission for it be obtained?Scope – does the location and the size of the site enable the provision required? Can it be accessed easily?Funding – can the funds be found to build it? Can they be sustained to keep it running?Hosting a major event leaves locals with improved facilitiesHosting sports events can be very expensive but many cities and countries compete to be awarded the football World Cup, the Commonwealth Games, the Olympics and a number of other competitions.There are pros and cons to this:Advantages of hosting a major sporting eventDisadvantages of hosting a major sporting eventImproved infrastructure - roads, rail links, accommodation (housing)Huge financial gamble - it may make a huge loss
2	One of the world's biggest oil rigs sank into the Atlantic Ocean last month. The rig, called P-36, sank in the waters about 75 miles off the coast of Brazil, South America, after a series of explosions damaged a pillar supporting it.The explosions killed ten workers and injured others. Workers struggled for days to save the rig, only to see it slowly topple over and sink into the ocean.Officials from the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, which owns the rig, were concerned after some of the 400,000 gallons of diesel fuel and crude oil on the rig leaked out. But the spill turned out to be smaller than expected.The problem now facing Brazil is the loss of oil production. The P-36 rig provided a large portion of the oil Brazil uses to make fuel. Now the country will have to import more oil from other countries to meet demands.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.
2	Weekly Reader editor Beth Rogers made three new friends in July--Naku, Kela, and Inuk. Her friends are about 14 feet long and weigh more than 1,000 pounds each! They are beluga whales that live at the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut.Beth met her new friends through a new program at the aquarium. The program gives visitors a chance to wade into the water with the whales and touch them.Visitors wear thick rubber overalls to stay warm in the cold water. They can stroke the whales and touch the animals' tongues. According to their trainers, the belugas love to have their tongues rubbed.Beluga whales eat about 50 pounds of fish each day. They make noises such as clicks, squeaks, whistles, and moos. Belugas use their sounds to send messages to one another and to help them find their prey.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

3	> Acids, bases and metals - Reactions of acids with metalsAcids, bases and metals - Reactions of acids with metalsAcids react with most metals and a salt is produced. But unlike the reaction between acids and bases we don't get any water. Instead we getThis is the general word equation for the reaction:The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae.

Scientists say that too many horseshoe crabs are being caught by fishermen. Fishermen use horseshoe crabs to catch fish.Scientists fear that many animals will be endangered if there are too few horseshoe crabs. Many animals eat horseshoe crabs.To help the horseshoe crab, the government has made a rule saying how many crabs each state can catch. States must not catch more than that number. Scientists say the rule may mean there will be more horseshoe crabs soon.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

4	Scientists believe the Universe began in a hot ‘big bang’ about 13,600 million years ago. The Universe continues to expand today. The evidence for the Big Bang theory includes the existence of a microwave background radiation, and red-shift.Stars do not remain the same, but change as they age. The Universe contains extremely dense objects called black holes, and may consist mostly of dark matter that cannot be seen.You should know how stars are formed.Stars form from massive clouds of dust and gas in space.Gravity pulls the dust and gas together.As the gas falls together, it gets hot. A star forms when it is hot enough for nuclear reactions to start. This releases energy, and keeps the star hot. The outward pressure from the expanding hot gases is balanced by the force of the star's gravity. Our sun is at this stable phase in its life. Gravity pulls smaller amounts of dust and gas together, which form planets in orbit around the star.The Sun is halfway through its 10 billion year stable phaseBack to Living for the future indexThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

2	For years, scientists have known about a group of icy objects, called, in our solar system. They circle the sun between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. Scientists thought centaurs were made of ice and were almost completely smooth. But recent photos of one of those objects, named Asbolus 8405, are proving scientists wrong.Rather than finding a smooth surface, scientists discovered a crater near one end of Asbolus 8405. And centaurs are not made entirely of ice, either. Scientists saw material inside the crater that did not look like frozen water. Some scientists now say centaurs are made of a mixture of water, methane, and ammonia ice.Asbolus 8405 formed when the solar system first formed, scientists say. They hope that the object will help them learn more about what the solar system was like when it first formed.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

0	The Bowler family of England took a trip back in time last year. The Bowlers moved into a house that did not have electricity or a telephone. The Bowlers lived for three months as a family would live in the year 1900.The family even had to wear clothes from the year 1900. The clothes were not comfortable. The girls wore long dresses that they often tripped on.For fun, the Bowlers played card games. They also built a puppet theater and put on puppet shows.TV cameras took pictures while the Bowlers lived in the old house. Those pictures were made into a TV program calledThese are just a few of the rules the Bowlers had to follow while living in the 1900 house:All meals had to be cooked using recipes from 1900. They seldom ate eggs or bananas because they were expensive.The family had to use toothbrushes from 1900. They were made of pig and horse hair.The family lived on the amount of money a 1900 family earned--about $36 per month.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

2	"Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a group of tiny people inhabited caves on a remote tropical island in Indonesia. That is a country that lies between Asia and Australia. The little people made stone tools to spear giant rats and hunted large lizards and tiny elephants in packs.Believe it or not, this is no fairy tale. Inside a cave on the Indonesian island of Flores, scientists discovered the bones of seven people who belonged to a new, or type, of human. The most intact skeleton was that of a child-sized adult female.""If you told me an alien spacecraft had landed on Flores, I would have been less surprised than by this discovery,"" said Peter Brown, one of the scientists behind the rare find.The miniature humans had bulging eyes and brains that were no bigger than those of newborn babies. Standing barely 3 feet tall, an adult was about the size of a 3-year-old child today.Their tiny size earned them the nickname ""hobbits."" That name comes from the dwarflike creatures that appear in books byWhat is even more amazing about the scientists' discovery is that the small humans lived as recently as 13,000 years ago. That may seem very long ago to you, but modern humans existed at the same time.Did the newly discovered hobbits and modern humans live on Flores together? Scientists estimate that modern humans reached the island more than 35,000 years ago. Whether the two groups interacted remains a mystery, but scientists hope the discovery will teach them more about the history of humans.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
3	> Listening - Showing you are listeningIt sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it.Good listeners show that they are listening by:Making eye contact with the person that is talking to themUsing facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is saidAllowing the person who is speaking finish before they respondRepeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understandReferring back to comments that have already been madeRead this conversation between Abdul, Emily and Matt.

Use the first person plural to say what we did.Sometimes you may have to change the tense from the one in the notes.You may need to use the verb comer instead of the nounBe prepared to make some guesses of your own. If there was no canteen where did the pupils eat? Probably at home!Did you do the homework as well? If not, refer to Marisol and show you can use a different verb ending.Don't just stick to the notes here. Add something to introduce the next point. It's time to give your opinion.If necessary, add something extra to set the scene.Remember to change the tense to fit.Which expressions of time should you use?Don't forget to put an article before the days of the week.You are now talking about the situation generally, so you probably need to use the present tense.Remember to compare Spanish and English holidays.Show that you know the difference betweenTake this opportunity to put in another different tense.You will generally be told about how many words to write. Take note of this because you won't get any more marks for writing too much and you may lose marks for writing too little.Use what you're given. The question and the notes both give you lots of language that you can use in your answer.Remember to adapt the information in the question so that any verbs and pronouns refer to whoever you're writing about.If you have to work from notes, think about the way they would be set out in English and what you would have to add.Think carefully about what tense and what person of the verb to use. Once you have decided, make sure that you use that tense and person every time it's appropriate.After you have finished, check your work for verb endings and tenses.In a piece of writing, numbers are generally written as words.To make your writing more interesting, join short sentences using a link word.To make sure of a higher grade try to use extra structures (such as different verb tenses) and vocabulary that you know.
4	There are two opposing historic images of the Depression in 1930s Britain:- lines of broken, unemployed men, rows of shabby housing - and- new washing machines, automobiles, electricity and cinemas.In 1929, the Wall Street Crash plunged the USA into economic depression. The Americans were alarmed, so they called in their loans to other countries and put up customs barriers to stop imports of foreign goods. This created a depression across the rest of the world.Unemployment in Britain rose to 2.5 million (25 per cent of the workforce) in 1933. Worst hit were the areas of heavy industry (eg coal, iron, steel, shipbuilding) in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the north of England. These industries were already struggling because they had not modernised after the war and had been badly affected by competition from other countries. The Depression meant that now these industries crumbled. For example, when the coal mine, the steel works and Palmer's shipyard closed down in Jarrow in the north-east of England, every single man in the town was madelaid off from work because they are no longer neededThe people of Jarrow organised a march to London - a crusade to seek help from the government, but they were told to go home and work out their own salvation'. In fact,the government did not have a clue how to cope with the Depression, and the policies it did put into action were either useless, or made matters worse.Key industries closed in Jarrow sparking the Jarrow Crusade.In the south-east of England where newsuch as chemicals, electrical goods and automobiles had been developed,. In fact, people with jobs benefited from the Depression because prices fell and they could buy more!of the Depression was the Wall Street Crash, but other factors also helped to create the Depression out of the Crash. To understand them, you need to understand that theof an economic depression is a reduction in spending, and that the way to end a depression is to get people to buy things:- Import duties discouraged trade, which harmed the economy. The reduction in trade particularly hit the shipbuilding and railway industries if there was no trade, there was no need for transport.- when there is unemployment and uncertainty, people cut back on spending and save 'for a rainy day'. This then makes businesses go bankrupt and causes the unemployment they feared.- unemployed people have no wage and cannot buy things, which causes more businesses to go bankrupt and creates more unemployment.Outdated practices - British heavy industry was out of dateand labour-intensive. When orders dried up, the only way they could cope was to lay off workers.made the depression worse: - The increase in unemployment meant the government was faced with a vastly increased expenditure on benefits. So in 1931, it raised income tax and cut unemployment pay by 10 per cent and introduced the means test. These measures reduced the amount of money people had to spend and made the Depression worse. - The Import Duties Act (1932) was designed to protect British industry, but this merely reduced trade and made the Depression worse.Cutting unemployment pay by 10 per cent.Adding import duties to goods from abroad.Where the total currency in a country is equal in value to the amount of gold that the country owns.- this allowed the government to increase the amount of money in circulation.Reduced interest rates - this reduced people's debt payments and made more money available to spend, but also encouraged them to take out loans to spend more.The Special Areas Act (1934) - tried to attract light industries to the 'distressed' areas.Local councils built 500,000 council houses, which pumped money into the economy.Some people (especially in the south of England) become morePrices fell in the Depression, which meant more money for luxuries.Hire-purchase allowed people to get luxuries 'on the never-never'.Family size fell, which meant more money for luxuries.Improvements at work such as reduction in working hours, holidays with pay.Three million new houses were built in the 1930s.There was a 1200 per cent increase in homes with electricity.Better leisure such as cinema, dance halls, swimming baths and football matches.A better diet. Free school milk was introduced after 1934Better health, which meant people were taller, fitter and heavier.Divide the facts in this topic into two lists - 'good things' and 'bad things' about the 1930s.As part of your revision, think about thethere was a depression in the 1930s.Britain experienced a depression in the 1930s.the government dealt with the economic problems of the 1930s.

A team of scientists recently discovered how the dinosaur got so big:had a huge burst of growth as a teenager.bones, the team learned that the dinosaur grew very large, very quickly. At age 13,. (A ton is equal to 2,000 pounds.) Between the ages of 14 and 18,gained almost 5 pounds a day. By age 18, the dinosaur weighed a whopping 4 tons!lived to about 30 years of age. As an adult, the dinosaur reached its full weight of 6 tons. That is huge!had to eat a lot to grow so fast. What was the meat-eating giant's favorite food?

1	On April 22, millions of people around the world will celebrate Earth Day. People are finding many ways-from inventions to projects-to help protect the environment. Look inside to find out how they are working to make a difference.Earth Day inspires people to take action and help the environment. Many people will be spreading the message that the Earth needs to be cared for year-round.Kids around the world will participate in Earth Day events. Some will clean up parks. Others will plant trees. What do you plan to do on Earth Day to help the environment?One way to protect the Earth is to reduce pollution. Pollution occurs when people harm the air, land, and water. Most air pollution comes from the burning of fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas. The fuel is used to run cars and heat homes. Water and land pollution often come from chemicals and garbage.Some Earth-friendly inventions help reduce pollution. These inventions conserve, or use fewer, energy and natural resources such as water. Take a look at some of these exciting inventions.? An Earthship is actually not a ship at all. It is a house built to save energy and water. Earthships use solar power from the sun for heat and electricity.Earthships are made from recycled material. Old tires, aluminum soda cans, and glass bottles are some common materials used to build Earthships.Many people who live in Earthships also recycle their water. When it rains, they collect and filter the rainwater. The filter makes the water safe to use for drinking, washing, and cooking. The leftover water is saved for other uses, such as watering indoor plants.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

The alkenes are a family of hydrocarbons that share the same general formula. This is CThe general formula means that the number of hydrogen atoms in an alkene is double the number of carbon atoms. For example, ethene is C. Alkene molecules can be represented by displayed formulae, in which each atom is shown as its symbol (C or H) and the chemical bonds between them by a straight line.Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons. They contain a double bond, which is shown as two lines between two of the carbon atoms. The presence of this double bond allows alkenes to react in ways that alkanes cannot. They can react with oxygen in the air, so they could be used as fuels. But they are more useful than that. They can be used to make ethanol - alcohol - and polymers - plastics - two crucial products in today's world.found in alcoholic drinks such as wine and beer. It is also useful as a fuel. For use in cars and other vehicles, it is usually mixed with petrol.Ethanol can be manufactured by reacting ethene (fromCracking is the breaking down of large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller, more useful hydrocarbon molecules by vapourizing them and passing them over a hot catalyst.A catalyst changes the rate of a chemical reaction without being changed by the reaction itself.of phosphoric acid is used to ensure a fast reaction.Notice that ethanol is the only product. The process is continuous – as long as ethene and steam are fed into one end of the reaction vessel, ethanol will be produced. These features make it an efficient process, but there is a problem. Ethene is made from, which is a non-renewable resource. It cannot be replaced once it is used up and it will run out one day.Ethanol can be made by reacting ethene with steam, but it can also be made by a process called fermentation.Sugar from plant material is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide by fermentation.

In fact, more than 90% of the world’s ethanol is made by fermentation.Alkenes can be used to make polymers. Polymers are very large molecules made when many smaller molecules join together, end-to-end. The smaller molecules are calledlots of monomer molecules    →    a polymer moleculeThe animation shows how several chloroethene monomers can join end-to-end to make poly(chloroethene), which is also called PVC.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment. For information on how to enable JavaScript please go to theYou will not be able to see this content until you have JavaScript switched on.Alkenes can act as monomers because they have a double bond:Ethene can polymerise to form poly(ethene), which is also called polythene.Propene can polymerise to form poly(propene), which is also called polypropylene.Different polymers have different properties, so they have different uses. The table below gives some examples.water pipes and insulation on electricity cablesPolymers have properties that depend on the chemicals they are made from, and the conditions in which they are made. Modern polymers have many uses, including:hydrogels for making soft contact lenses and disposable nappy linersPolymer molecules can have branches coming off them, which change the properties of the polymer.Plasticisers are substances that let the polymer molecules slide over each other more easily. This makes the polymer softer and more flexible. For example, poly(chloroethene) or PVC is a hard polymer. Unplasticised PVC, usually called uPVC, is used to make pipes and window frames. PVC with plasticisers is soft and flexible. It is used for floor coverings, raincoats and car dashboards.Poly(ethenol) is a polymer that dissolves in water to make slime. The viscosity of the slime can be changed to make it thick or runny by varying the amount of water.One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they aresuitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers.Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene) are not biodegradable. This means that, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from such degradable polymers are already available.Polymers can be burnt or incinerated. They release a lot of heat energy when they burn and this can be used to heat homes or to generate electricity.There are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are produced unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they areMany polymers can be recycled. This reduces the disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But the different polymers must be separated from each other first, and this can be difficult and expensive to do.

You have to remember, for instance, that −10 is less than −5.Sometimes it helps to see negative numbers on a number line.- 5, −2, 3, −9, −2.5, 0.5The lowest number in this list is. From lowest to highest, the order is:You need to be able to work out rises and falls in temperature using negative numbers.A number line can help us to understand changes in temperature. For example, if the overnight temperature fell to −4°C, and by midday it had risen to 7°C, then, counting from −4 up to 7 on the number line,the temperature has gone up by 11°C.At 6pm, the temperature was 3°C. By midnight, it had dropped to −5°C. How great was the fall in temperature?If so, well done. You counted down 3, then another 5, to get 8.If you had problems, look at the number line.Counting down from 3 to -5 on the number line, we get 8 degrees.At 7am, Joe recorded the temperature in his garden as being −4°C. He went back out outside at 1pm and found that the temperature had increased by 12°C. What was the temperature at 1pm?Starting at −4 and counting up 12, we get to 8.At 6pm, the outside temperature was 7°C. By 6am, the temperature had dropped by 13°C. What was the temperature at 6am?If so, well done. You counted down 13 from 7.If you had problems, look at the number line:Starting at 7 and counting down by 13 on the number line, we get to −6. So the temperature at 6am was -6°C.Here is a table showing temperatures in cities worldwide:You could be asked to find the difference in temperature between two cities, eg, Moscow and London.Starting at −9, we count up 14 to get to 5. So the difference in temperatures is 14°C.What is the difference in temperature between Moscow and Oslo?If so, well done. You started at -9 and counted up 4 to get to −5.If you had problems, look at the number line:Starting at −9 and counting up to −5, we get 4. So the difference in temperature is 4°C.To do algebra (especially graphs), you will need to know some basic facts about adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing with negative numbers.a negative number is the same as subtracting:eg 7 + (−3) is the same as 7 − 3 = 4a negative number is the same as adding:eg (−5) − (−2) is the same as (−5) + 2 = −3? If you had problems, remember that 4 − (−3) is the same as 4 + 3 = 7If you had problems, remember that 5 + (-8) is the same as 5 − 8 = −3Did you get 30? Remember that negative × negative =Division follows the same rules as multiplication. So, for example, −24 ÷ 6 = −4, because 24 ÷ 6 = 4 and the answer must be negative. Try this question:Did you get −21? Remember that negative × positive =This is the reverse of the last question. Did you get −7? Remembered that negative ÷ positive =

It is a beautiful bird and the symbol of our nation,"" says Martha Nudel. She is a spokesperson for the National Wildlife Refuge System. ""We know that we're protecting the planet in a way that is helping bald eagles and hundreds of other birds.""Bald eagles were in danger because many of them had been killed by hunters. They were also harmed by a chemical called DDT. It had been used to kill insects on farms until 1972.In 1963, only 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles were left in the continental United States. That included all of the states except Hawaii and Alaska. Today, there are nearly 10,000 pairs.Though bald eagles are no longer on the endangered species list, they are still protected.

4	In this section, we will look at resistance (measured in ohms) and how it is calculated in different types of circuit. We will look at how the resistance in the filament of a lamp changes when the filament heats up. You will also learn about diodes, heat-dependent resistors (called thermistors) and light-dependent resistors (LDRs).An electric current flows when charged particles called electrons move through a conductor. The moving electrons can collide with theAll elements are made of atoms. An atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons.An electrical conductor is a material which allows an electrical current to pass through it easily. It has a low resistance. A thermal conductor allows thermal energy to be transferred through it easily.. This is called resistance and it makes it harder for current to flow. These collisions make the conductor hot. It is this that makes a lamp filament hot enough to glow.. The greater the number of ohms, the greater the resistance.The equation below shows the relationship between resistance, voltage, current:) = volts (V) / amperes (A)The current flowing through a resistor at a constant temperature is directly proportional to the voltage across the resistor. So, if you double the voltage, the current also doubles. This is called Ohm’s Law. The graph shows what happens to the current and voltage when a resistor follows Ohm’s Law.Bicycles with battery operated lights often have different size bulbs for the front and rear lights. The filament in the front lamp has a resistance of 3 ohms. It takes a current of 0.6A. What voltage does it work at?The answer is 1.8V. If you didn't get the correct answer make sure you have used the formula correctly.So the voltage in the lamp is 3 x 0.6 = 1.8 voltsPut down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

2	"As students head back to school, many are focused more on ringtones than on blackboards. Nearly 44 percent of 10- to 18-year-olds in the United States own cell phones, according to a recent technology survey. Now some schools across the country are telling students to leave their mobile phones at home.New York City recently banned cell phones from its school system. Within a month of the ban, school officials took away 3,000 phones from students. Many schools are now asking this question: Should cell phones be allowed in school?Cell phones are often misused, say some education officials. Students have been caught making calls during class and even text messaging test answers to their friends. Plus, cell phones are among the most stolen objects in schools. Many teachers think getting rid of cell phones would prevent students from being distracted in class.Cell phones may not even be very useful during a school emergency, says Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services. He toldthat too many cell phone calls in an emergency would ""overload cell phone systems and … 911 operators.""or easy, way for kids to stay in touch with their families and make plans. Some schools allow their students to carry cell phones as long as the mobile devices are turned off in class.""I don’t see a reason to ban cell phones,"" Leland Dishman, an education official from Boaz, Alabama, told. ""Our kids are very responsible, and I do not expect much of a problem.""William Scharffe of the Michigan Association of School Boards agrees. ""Cell phones are OK as long as the school doesn’t object,"" he told""In some schools, students can use the phone at lunchtime and recess.""Cell phones have no place in schools.Cell phones are a necessity for students.Should cell phones be banned from schools?

4	Hinduism: beliefs about care of the planetThe relationship between human beings and the earth is increasingly complicated and urgent. Every day there are stories about pollution, global warming and animal species facing extinction. Religion is responding with views on the enviroment and our responsibility for it.Although human beings are seen as the most intelligent life form on earth, they are responsible for almost all thedone to the planet. If we imagined the earth is aged 46, all the damage done has taken place in the last 60 seconds of the earth's life.Hinduism is very concerned with the relationship between humanity and the environment.teaches that resources in the world become scarce because people use them for their own ends. People should use the worldand to repay God for the gifts he has given:For, so sustained by sacrifice, the gods will give you the food of your desire. Whoso enjoys their gift, yet gives nothing, is a thief, no more nor less.are treated with great respect because it is the most important type of plant life and, like all living things, has anIf there is but one tree of flowers and fruit within a village, that place is worthy of your respect.Krishna compares the whole of the world with the banyan treebecause it is so large and provides a home for many different creatures.prevents a Hindu from causing harm to any creatureIn India, Hindus take an active part in checking government schemes which might damage the environment, such as the building of large-scale dams which could cause the rivers to flood, destroying precious land and animals., and must be honoured in all its parts. Animals and plants, mountains and rivers, all form part of the earth, and many are worshipped for the noble qualities they possess. Cows, for example are so highly revered that killing of them is banned and those that no longer produce milk are retired, not slaughtered and special sanctuaries called goshallas have been created for them.In 1986, HRH Prince Philip, then President of the WWF International invited five leaders of five of the major religions of the world -- to meet to discuss how their faiths could helpThe meeting took place in Assisi in Italy, because it was the birth place of St Francis, the Catholic saint of ecology. From this meeting arose key statements by the five faiths outlining their own distinctive traditions and approach to the care for nature.In the Assisi Declarations on Nature of 1986 the Hindu statement was:The human role is not separate from nature. All objects in the universe, beings and non-beings, are pervaded by the same spiritual power.The human race, though at the top of the evolutionary pyramid at present, is not seen as something apart from earth and its many forms. People did not spring fully formed to dominate lesser life, but evolved out of these forms and are integrally linked with them.and the divine is expressed through all its forms. Reverence for life is an essential principle, as isNature cannot be destroyed without humanity destroying itself.The divine is not exterior to creation, but expresses itself through natural phenomena.

2	"For years, scientists have known about a huge hole in a layer of Earth's atmosphere. It's called the ozone hole. It is located above Antarctica. This year, the hole did something surprising. It split in two!Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.The pie chart shows the two most abundant gases in Earth""s atmosphere.Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.1. Ozone protects Earth from dangerous solar rays.2. The largest ozone hole formed in 2000.3. The ozone hole split in two.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

Another 120,000 kids each year are permanently disabled in accidents.The graph shows the number of kids ages 5 to 14 who were treated in emergency rooms in 1999 for injuries suffered while doing these four activities.""Summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids,"" said Dr. C. Everett Koop, who is head of the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Koop added, ""The good news is that families can take simple steps to ensure their kids stay out of emergency rooms.""The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents.In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger.Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law.Scooter accidents may be on the rise, but bicycles account for more injuries than scooters or any other product except cars, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign.In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head.The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets.

If people were the same size as atoms, the entire population of the world would fit into a box about a thousandth of a millimetre across!We usually imagine atoms as being like tiny balls:To make diagrams simpler we often draw atoms as circles:There are over a hundred different types of atom, and these are called. Each element has a special name. For example carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are all elements.Lead and gold are elements too. A piece of pure gold contains only gold atoms. A piece of pure lead contains only lead atoms.Chemical reactions join or split atoms to rearrange them. But they cannot change one element into another element, or anything simpler. A chemical reaction cannot turn lead into gold, becuse it can't change the atoms into different elements.Use your knowledge to help Spherox find his way home.More than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

4	Light can be used for digital communications - for example, in Morse code and in CD players. Light consists of transverse waves in which the electromagnetic vibrations are at 90º to the direction of travel. The speed of a wave can be calculated using its frequency and wavelength. Lasers produce intense narrow beams of light.Waves are vibrations that transfer energy from place to place without matter - solid, liquid or gas - being transferred. Think of a Mexican wave in a football crowd. The wave moves around the stadium, while each spectator stays in their seat - only moving up, and then down, when it is their turn.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

The substance is known as the medium, and it can be solid, liquid or gas. Sound waves andare like this: they must travel through a medium. It is the medium that vibrates as the waves travel through it.Other waves do not need to travel through a substance. They may be able to travel through a medium, but they do not have to. Visible light, infrared rays, microwaves, and other types ofEnergy travelling as waves in the form of changing electrical and magnetic fields., are like this. They can travel through empty space. Electrical or magnetic fields vibrate as the waves travel through them.All types of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, arewaves. In transverse waves the vibrations are at right angles to the direction of travel, as seen in the animation below of a wave sent down a piece of string. The hand moves up and down, as does each part of the string. But the wave moves along from left to right. Water waves and s-waves - one type of seismic wave - are also transverse waves.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

The amplitude of a wave is its maximum disturbance from its undisturbed position. Take care: the amplitude is not the distance between the top and bottom of a wave.The wavelength of a wave is the distance between a point on one wave and the same point on the next wave. It is often easiest to measure this from the crest of one wave to the crest of the next wave, but it doesn't matter where as long as it is the same point in each wave.The frequency of a wave is the number of waves produced by a source each second. It is also the number of waves that pass a certain point each second. The unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz). It is common for kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz) to be used when waves have very high frequencies. For example, most people cannot hear a high-pitched sound above 20kHz, radio stations broadcastLow frequency electromagnetic radiation used to transmit information such as television and radio programmes.with frequencies of about 100MHz, while most wireless computer networks operate at 2.4GHz.Check your understanding of this section by having a go at this activity.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

Letters and numbers are represented by a series of dots and dashes - a dash lasts three times longer than a dot.Morse code can be used to transmit signals in many different ways, including visible light, radio waves and electrical pulses.Sending information using electrical pulses requires wires, unlike visible light and radio waves, which are wireless. The use of visible light needs the transmitter and receiver to be in the line of sight. But it is more secure against eavesdroppers than radio waves.A laser - 'Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation' - produces an intense narrow beam of light. A typical laser beam might only spread out by 1m when shone onto a surface 1km away. The light waves in a laser beam are:When light waves are in the same phase, their crests all line up, as do their troughs.Laser beams are used to read information from CDs in CD players. The shiny surface of a CD contains microscopic pits in a spiral track. The pattern of pits contains digital information. The laser light is reflected off the surface of the CD as the disk spins, and is detected:the change in the amount of reflected light caused by entering or leaving a pit is interpreted as a 1no change in the amount of reflected light is interpreted as a 0
4	For the exam, you'll need to be able to recognise some of the hazard symbols used in chemistry and to explain what they mean. You may also be asked to give examples of chemicals that should be labelled with a particular hazard symbol, or suggest a suitable hazard symbol for a particular chemical.The diagrams on this page show some of the common hazard symbols used in chemistry, and their meanings. These symbols may be in a triangle or a square, and a chemical container might be labelled with more than one hazard symbol.Attacks and destroys living tissues, such as skin and eyes.Concentrated solutions of strong acids such aswould be labelled with the corrosive symbol. Concentrated solutions of strong alkalis such aswould also be labelled this way. Anyone using a corrosive substance should wear gloves and eye protection, such as goggles or a face shield.Not corrosive but will make the skin red or blister.The dilute solutions of acids and alkalis that you normally use at school would be labelled with the irritant symbol. Anyone using an irritant substance should wear eye protection such as goggles, and they should take care to wash any spills off their skin immediately.Can cause death, eg if swallowed, breathed in or absorbed by skin.would be labelled with the toxic symbol. Anyone using a toxic chemical would need to take great care. They should wear gloves and eye protection, and they may wear a mask over their mouth and nose or handle the chemical in a fume cupboard.Similar to toxic substances but not as dangerous.would be labelled with the harmful symbol. Anyone using a harmful substance should wear eye protection such as goggles, and they should take care to wash any spills off their skin immediately.would be labelled with the highly flammable symbol. In addition to the normal precautions of wearing eye protection, anyone using a highly flammable substance should take care to keep it away from flames and sparks, and also from oxidising substances.Provides oxygen to make other substances burn more fiercely.would be labelled with the oxidising symbol. Oxidising substances do not burn themselves but they provide oxygen for flammable substances to burn. In addition to the normal precautions of wearing eye protection, anyone using an oxidising substance should take care to keep it away from flammable substances, including clothing.Fed up of reading?

Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.'this story as giving people the right to exploit the environment. However, most people see themselves as beingfor the world created by God and they have to make their ownThe Bible has very little else specific to say about the environment, but it explains the principles ofIn the Old Testament the Jews were told to rest the land once every 50 years so that it would produce more in the future (Leviticus 25:8-11). They were also ordered not to destroy trees when they were attacking a city:When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an axe to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees of the field people, that you should besiege them?It is clear that the earth still belongs to God not to humans:The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.In the New Testament Jesus stresses God’s concern for life:Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labour or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these.the environment by holding harvest festivals each year when theyThe Christian church has recently become moremade a statement about it in 1988:The earth and all life on it is a gift from God given us to share and develop, not to dominate and exploit. Our actions have consequences for the rights of others and for the resources of the earth. The goods of the earth and the beauties of nature are to be enjoyed and celebrated as well as consumed. We have the responsibility to create a balanced policy between consumption and conservation. We must consider the welfare of future generations in our planning for and utilisation of the earth’s resources.The dignity of nature as creation needs to be bound up with our responsibility for the preservation of life.Christians repudiate all ill-considered exploitation of nature which threatens to destroy it and, in turn, to make man the victim of degradation.Care of water resources and attention to climate change are matters of grave importance for the entire human family.

4	Electric motors transfer electrical energy into kinetic energy, using magnets and coils of wire. There is a relationship between electrical power, voltage and current (power = voltage × current).Whenever useful energy is transferred, some energy that is not useful is also transferred – we say such energy is 'wasted'. When you measure the efficiency of a device, you measure how much of the energy supplied is useful.The cost of electricity depends upon the amount of electrical power used, the amount of time it is used for, and the charge made for each unit of electricity. It is possible to reduce heat losses from homes using insulation, and this saves money, but some methods of insulation are more cost-effective than others.If you are given information such as a diagram, you should be able to explain how an electric motor works.A simple electric motor can be built using a coil of wire that is free to rotate between two opposite magnetic poles. When an electric current flows through the coil, the coil experiences a force and moves.The direction of the current must be reversed every half turn, otherwise the coil comes to a halt again. This is achieved using a conducting ring split in two, called a. A coil of wire is used with lots of turns to increase the effect of the magnetic field.The animation shows a simple electric motor, with the arrow heads showing the direction of the current.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

The amount of electrical charge that moves in a circuit depends on the current flow and how long it flows for.The equation below shows the relationship between charge, current and time:charge (coulomb, C) = current (ampere, A) × time (second, s)For a given amount of electrical charge that moves, the amount of energy transferred increases as the voltage increases.The equation below shows the relationship between energy transferred, voltage and charge:energy transferred (joule, J) = potential difference (volt, V) × charge (coulomb, C)Check your understanding of the relationship between charge, current and time by having a go at this activity.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

It can only be transferred from one form to another, or moved.Energy that is 'wasted', like the heat energy from an electric lamp, does not disappear. Instead, it is transferred into the surroundings, and spreads out so much that it becomes very difficult to do anything useful with it.Ordinary electric lamps contain a thin metal filament that glows when electricity passes through it. However, most of the electrical energy is transferred as heat energy instead of light energy.Below is the Sankey diagram for a typical filament lamp.Modern energy-saving lamps work in a different way. They transfer a greater proportion of electrical energy as light energy.Below is the Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lamp.Sankey diagram for a typical energy-saving lampFrom the diagram, you can see that much less electrical energy is transferred, or 'wasted', as heat energy.The efficiency of a device such as a lamp can be calculated using this equation:efficiency = (useful output ÷ total input ) × 100The efficiency of the filament lamp is (10 ÷ 100) × 100 = 10%. This means that 10% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (90% is transferred as heat energy).The efficiency of the energy-saving lamp is (75 ÷ 100) × 100 = 75%. This means that 75% of the electrical energy supplied is transferred as light energy (25% is transferred as heat energy).Note that the efficiency of a device will always be less than 100%.The amount of electrical energy transferred to an appliance depends on its power, and on the length of time it is switched on for. The amount of mains electrical energy transferred is measured in kilowatt-hours (The equation below shows the relationship between energy transferred, power and time:energy transferred (kilowatt-hour, kWh) = power (kilowatt, kW) × time (hour, h)Note that power is measured in kilowatts here, instead of the more usual watts. To convert from W to kW you must divide by 1,000.For example, 2,000W = 2,000 ÷ 1,000 = 2kW.Also note that time is measured in hours here, instead of the more usual seconds. To convert from seconds to hours you must divide by 3,600.For example, 1,800s = 1,800 ÷ 3,600 = 0.5 hours.Electricity meters measure the number of units of electricity used in a home or other building. The more units used, the greater the cost. The cost of the electricity used is calculated using this equation:cost = power (kW) × time (hour) × cost of 1 kWh (pence)An electric fire needs 2 kW. It is switched on for 3 hours. If each kWh costs 10p, how much does it cost to run the fire?cost = power × time × cost of 1 kWh       = 2 kW × 3 h × 10pA TV needs 250 W. It is switched on for 30 minutes. If each kWh costs 8p, how much does it cost to run the TV?cost = power × time × cost of 1 kWh       = 0.250 W × 0.5 h × 8pElectricity can be used to heat homes and offices. If some of the heat escapes from the house, it costs money and wastes resources. There are several ways that heat can escape from a house, and different ways to reduce these losses. In deciding how cost-effective an energy-saving measure is, we need to know what its payback time is:payback time = cost of energy-saving measure ÷ money saved each yearDouble-glazing might cost £2,500 and save £100 a year. What is the payback time?payback time = cost of energy-saving measure ÷ money saved each yearTake a look at this image showing heat loss from a house.red shows where most heat is lost - through the windows and roofwindows - fit double glazing and curtainsgaps around the door - fit draught excludersthe walls - fit cavity wall insulationHeat energy is transferred from homes byThe transfer of heat energy through a material - without the material itself moving.through the walls, floor, roof and windows. It is also transferred from homes byThe transfer of heat energy through a moving liquid or gas.. For example, cold air can enter a house through gaps in doors and windows, and convection currents can transfer heat energy in the loft to the roof tiles. Heat energy also leaves the house by radiation through the walls, roof and windows.There are some simple ways to reduce heat loss, including fitting carpets, curtains and draught excluders.Heat loss through windows can be reduced by using double glazing. There can be either air or aA volume that contains no matter - space is almost a vacuum.between the two panes of glass. Air is a poor conductor of heat, while a vacuum can only transfer heat energy by radiation.Heat loss through walls can be reduced using cavity wall insulation. This involves blowing insulating material into the gap between the brick and the inside wall, which reduces the heat loss by conduction. The material also prevents air circulating inside the cavity, therefore reducing heat loss by convection.Heat loss through the roof can be reduced by laying loft insulation. This works in a similar way to cavity wall insulation.from 2006 about energy efficiency in homes.

2	Honest Abe's Library: Lincoln's Papers Get a New HomeA group of librarians in Springfield, Illinois, has been booked up. The librarians are busy making sure the world's largest collection of information on President Abraham Lincoln gets to its new home safely.The documents are on their way to the new Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library. The library is located in Springfield--the capital of Illinois. It is scheduled to open this fall.The library will be the new home of the Illinois State Historical Library. Although the new library is only blocks away from the old one, the move hasn't been easy.The six-week move involved several trucks and an army of people to help pack and transport nearly 12 million items. Of those items, about 47,000 books, maps, prints, documents, and other items are related to Lincoln.Abraham Lincoln was president during the Civil War (1861-1865). The U.S. Civil War was fought between the Northern states and Southern states. One of the main issues of the war was that the South wanted the right to own slaves. The North wanted toMore than 600,000 Americans died in the Civil War--more than any other war in history. The Civil War ended when the South surrendered.Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) left his mark on Illinois. Although Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Kentucky, he worked as a lawyer in Springfield before he became the 16th president of the United States, in 1861.The library's large collection of research on Lincoln includes many important. An artifact is a human-made object from the past.Among the artifacts is a handwritten copy of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. It is one of only five surviving copies. In 1863, Lincoln delivered the famous speech at the battlefield of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania.A museum dedicated to the life of Lincoln is also being built to accompany the library. The museum is scheduled to open in early 2005.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

2	"Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools?If you're like most schoolkids, you've recited the Pledge of Allegiance more times than you can remember. But now students in three public school districts in California are no longer allowed to say those historic words.A federal judge in California ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance isbecause it contains the phrase ""under God."" If something does not uphold the rules of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.For years, Michael Newdow of California has fought to have the phrase removed from the pledge. He continually argues that because of the pledge's reference to God, his elementary school daughter should not have to listen to it recited daily.Last year, the case did not make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the recent lower court's ruling, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court will now hear the controversial case.Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools because of the phrase ""under God""? Discuss in class. Then cast your vote atAccording to the federal court, the phrase ""under God"" suggests that the government supports religion. That violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to part of this amendment as the separation of church and state.Newdow provides the reverse argument for removing the reference to God from the pledge. He says, ""Imagine you send your kids to school every day, and the teachers [make] them stand up and say, ""We are one nation that denies God exists.""The pledge represents a way for many Americans to express their, or loyalty to the country. ""Our school board has long supported [the pledge] as an appropriate patriotic exercise for willing students,"" says Steven Ladd, the superintendent from one of the California school districts affected by the ruling.Others point out that the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem contain religious references. Critics of the ruling argue that saying the pledge is. Kids don't have to say the pledge if they don't want to participate.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
1	February is the month in which millions of Americans celebrate African American history. Many important events in African American history took place in February.For example, Rosa Parks was born during this month. In 1955, Parks was arrested when she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Alabama, city bus. In some places at that time, it was illegal for a black person to sit in the front of a bus.of, or refusal to use, the bus company. Many blacks refused to ride the city buses for more than a year, until those unfair laws were changed.In 1926, the historian Carter G. Woodson declared a week honoring black history. He chose the February week with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Douglass was a former slave who, in the 1800s, fought to outlaw slavery. The celebration was changed to a monthlong event in 1976.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.
4	The number of protons in the atom of an element determines its place in the Periodic Table. The number of electrons in an atom is the same as the number of protons. These electrons are arranged in shells or 'energy levels' around the nucleus. The arrangement of electrons determines the chemical properties of an element.Electron arrangement of the first 20 elementsat different distances around the nucleus. As we move across each row of the Periodic Table the proton numberby one for each element. This means the number of electrons alsoStarting from the simplest element, hydrogen, and moving through the elements in order we can see how the electrons fill the shells. The the innermost shell (or lowest) of electrons is filled first. This shell can contain a maximum ofNext, the second shell fills with electrons. This can hold a maximum ofelectrons. When this is filled, electrons go into the third shell, which also holds a maximum ofelectrons. Then the fourth shell begins to fill.The table shows the number of electrons in each shell for the first 20 elements in the Periodic Table.The electronic structure of each element can be shown simply as the number of electrons in each shell. For example, lithium is 2.1, neon is 2.8.8, and calcium is 2.8.8.2.The arrangement of electrons can also be shown using a. Electron shells are drawn as circles, with the electrons on each shown as dots or crosses. Here are some examples:A black dot represents the nucleus. Lithium atoms have three electrons. A small circle around the nucleus has two red dots on, representing the first shell with two electrons. A larger outer circle has one red dot on, representing the second shell with one electron.Fluorine atoms have nine electrons. Two of these fit into the first shell, and the remaining seven electrons fit into the second shell.Neon atoms have ten electrons. Two of these fit into the first shell, and the remaining eight electrons fit into the second shell. Because its outer shell is full, neon isAtoms are stable if their outer shell contains its maximum number of electrons.(ie, the eighth group) of the Periodic Table.Sodium atoms have 11 electrons. Two of these fit into the first shell, eight fit into the second shell and the last one fits into the third shell.Calcium atoms have 20 electrons. Two of these fit into the first shell, eight fit into the second shell, another eight into the third shell, and the last two fit into the fourth shell.The way electrons are arranged in an atom is called the. As you have seen on the previous page, there is a link between an element's electronic structure and its place in the Periodic Table.You can work out an element's electronic structure from its place in the Periodic TableThe diagram below shows a section of the Periodic Table, with the elements arranged as usual in order of their atomic number from 2 to 20. The red numbers above each chemical symbol show the electrons in each shell.Electron arrangement for a section of the periodic tablethe number of shells is the same as the period number.As you go across each period from left to right the outer shell gradually becomes filled with electrons. The outer shell contains just one electron on the left hand side of the table, but is filled by the time you get to the right hand side.the number of electrons in the outermost shell is the same as the group number.Each element in a group therefore has the same number of electrons in its outer shell.to this rule, since although it comes after Group 7 it is not called 'Group 8'; and it contains helium, which has only two electrons in its outer shell.Working out electronic structure from the Periodic TableHere's how to use the Periodic Table to work out an electronic structure:Find the element in the Periodic Table. Work out which period it's in, and draw that number of circles around the nucleus.Work out which group the element is in and draw that number of electrons in the outer circle - with eight for Group 0 elements (except helium).Fill the other circles with electrons (remember: two in the first, eight in the second and third, 18 in the fourth).Finally, count your electrons and check that they equal the atomic number.Working out electronic structure from the atomic numberof an atom is the number ofit has. This is the same as the number of electrons. If we know the atomic number we can work out the arrangement of the electrons.Fill the shells starting from the smallest and going outward.For example silicon has atomic number 16. So we have to fill the shells with 16 electrons. That makes 2 in the first (to fill it), 8 in the second shell (to fill that) and 6 left to go into the third shell. So silicon has electronic structure 2.8.6Read on if you are taking theElectron arrangement and chemical properties of Group 1 - HigherAn atom is the smallest part of an element that still has the properties of that element, comprising electrons surrounding a nucleus of protons and neutrons.All atoms of an element have the same atomic number, the same number of protons and electrons, and so the same chemical properties.An electron is a very small negatively-charged particle found in an atom in the space surrounding the nucleus.in their highest occupied energy level (the outer shell).

Ion charge helps determine a substance's acidity or alkalinityAs you go down Group 7 the atoms become larger, and the highest occupied energy level (the outer shell) becomes further from the nucleus. The force of attraction between the positively-charged nucleus and a negatively-charged electron from another atom becomes weaker.As a result, it becomes harder to attract and gain an electron the larger the atom becomes. The more difficult it is to gain these outer electrons, the less reactive a halogen is.For example chlorine is less reactive than fluorine because the outer electrons in a chlorine atom are further from the nucleus than the outer electrons in a fluorine atom. It is harder for a chlorine atom to gain an electron than it is for a fluorine atom.Astatine atoms, with 6 shells, are the largest atoms in Group 7.

They can be used to scan for birth defects in unborn babies and for defects in manufactured equipment. They can also be used to clean delicate equipment without the need to take it apart.Seismic waves travel through the Earth. There are two types - P waves and S waves. They have different properties and they can give scientists information about the Earth's structure.Sound waves are longitudinal waves. Their vibrations occur in the same direction as the direction of travel. Sound waves can only travel through a solid, liquid or gas.When an object or substance vibrates, it produces sound.

This week's issue isIn 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems.The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

Recently, the Australian government added another 386 miles to the park.The Great Barrier Reef is a series of coral reefs that were formed by billions of tiny creatures called. As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps then live on top of the polyp shells. Over thousands of years, the polyp shells form a reef.The Great Barrier Reef acts as a barrier for the northeastern coast of Australia. The reef prevents waves from slamming into the coastline and, or washing away, too much land. It also provides a home for fish and other animals, including the dugong, a large mammal.A colony of coral polyps can grow as much as 4 inches in a year.Reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef are under stress. Pollution and disease are killing the polyps, and tourists take pieces of coral. Reefs are also damaged by ships and fishing nets, which break off sections of coral.The damage is widespread, experts say. According to one report, by the World Resources Institute, more than half the world's reefs are at risk.Australian government officials hope by expanding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, they will help protect the reef and its inhabitants.The expansion of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park will protect both the reef and an endangered marine animal called theThe plant-eating dugong is a cousin of the manatee, or sea cow, which is found in the warm waters of Florida.

3	> Paragraphs - How paragraphs are set outParagraphs - How paragraphs are set outThere are two main ways of setting out paragraphs, with a few small variations:By putting an indent at the startThe first example shows how new paragraphs can be started on the next available line, but with the first word beginning slightly to the right, or indented.       We've just come back from a lovely holiday in Southsea. The weather was glorious and Albert has still got a deep, golden glow from the sunshine. It's a pity it can't be like that all year round.       The hotel we stayed in was spotless. We felt like royalty because the bedsheets were changed twice, in the same week! I told Albert not to get too used to it as I wasn't going to carry that sort of thing on when we got home. We also got nice, clean fluffy towels every other day too.The second example shows how new paragraphs can be started by missing a line. In this type of example, indenting the first new word is not necessary.We've just come back from a lovely holiday in Southsea.

4	Electricity is supplied to consumers through the National Grid at a very high voltage to reduce energy losses during transmission. Transformers are used to increase or decrease the voltage of the supply. Electricity is charged in units. One unit is equivalent to one kilowatt of electricity used for one hour.Power stations are built in order to generate electricity. The diagram shows the main steps involved.the fuel is burned to boil water to make steamthe spinning turbine turns a generator which produces electricitythe electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltageThe energy needed to boil the water comes from fossil fuels or nuclear fuels. Renewable energy resources such as wind and wave power may drive the generators directly.A transformer is an electrical device that changes the voltage of an alternating current (ac) supply, such as the mains electrical supply. A transformer changes a high-voltage supply into a low-voltage one, or vice versa.A transformer that increases the voltage is calledA transformer that decreases the voltage is calledElectricity is transferred from power stations to consumers through the wires and cables of the National Grid. When a current flows through a wire some energy is lost as heat. The higher the current, the more heat is lost. To reduce these losses,the National Grid transmits electricity at a low currentPower stations produce electricity at 25,000V. Electricity is sent through the National Grid cables at 400,000V, 275,000V and 132,000V.Step-up transformers are used at power stations to produce the very high voltages needed to transmit electricity through the National Grid power lines. These high voltages are too dangerous to use in the home, so step-down transformers are used locally to reduce the voltage to safe levels. The voltage of household electricity is about 230V.You should be able to calculate the cost of using an electrical appliance when given enough information about it.transferred to an appliance depends on its power and the length of time it is switched on. The amount of mains electrical energy transferred is measured in kilowatt-hours, kWh. One unit is 1kWh.The equation below shows the relationship between energy transferred, power and time:energy transferred (kWh) = power (kW) × time (h)Note that power is measured in kilowatts here instead of the more usual watts. To convert from W to kW you must divide by 1000.For example, 2000W = 2000 ÷ 1000 = 2kW.Also note that time is measured in hours here, instead of the more usual seconds. To convert from seconds to hours you must divide by 3600.For example, 1800s = 1800 ÷ 3600 = 0.5 hours.Electricity meters measure the number of units of electricity used in a home or other building. The more units used, the greater the cost. The cost of the electricity used is calculated using this equation:total cost = number of units × cost per unitFor example, if 5 units of electricity are used at a cost of 8p per unit, the total cost will be 5 × 8 = 40p.Check your understanding of working out the cost of electricity by having a go at this activity.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

3	"> Forces - Weight, mass and gravityPeople often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg).The mass of an object is theor ""stuff"" it contains. The more matter an object contains, the greater its mass. An elephant contains more matter than a mouse, so it has a greater mass. Mass is measured inA 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong.Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planetWeight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is thebetween the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be.Weight is a force, so it's measured in. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut'sThe weight of an object changes if the strength of gravity changesRemember: a mass of 1kg has a weight of about 10N on Earth.Something is pulling your mouse towards this link.Join Questionaut's quest to find his friend's hat.More than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

2	"What a difference a year can make. Last winter, monarch butterflies died off in record numbers. This year, researchers are reporting that these delicate creatures have made an impressive comeback. The overall monarch butterfly population is recovering.The healthy number of monarchs has many scientists puzzled. ""It's amazing that they recovered so well,"" said butterfly expert Bill Calvert.In January 2002, a severe storm killed millions of monarchs that were spending the winter in Mexico. ""The data this winter indicates that the monarchs are moving back toward their average population size,"" said Lincoln Brower, another butterfly expert.The data collected this winter shows that monarch, or groups, covered about 20 acres of forests in Mexico. That is close to the average number of 24 acres from 1993 to 2001. After last year's unusual winter storm, the colonies covered only about 5 acres., or move, south from the United States and Canada to their winter homes in the mountains of Mexico. The orange-and- black monarch butterflies return to the United States and Canada in the spring.Butterfly experts and the Mexican government are concerned that illegal logging is destroying the monarchs', or home. They are worried because one of the top layers of the forest, called the, acts as an umbrella to protect monarchs.Illegally cutting down trees thins the canopy. Without the canopy, monarchs are exposed to cold, wet weather, which can kill them. Government officials in Mexico are working with environmental groups to stop illegal logging and save the forests.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
2	The U.S. Mint is pinning two new tails on the nickel. After 65 years, this coin is getting an updated look.The heads side will continue to feature the image of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States. His Monticello home in Virginia will be removed from the tails side of the coin for the next three years.In its place will be two new designs. They will celebrate the 200th anniversary, or, of two important events that took place during Jefferson's time in office. Those events are the Louisiana Purchase and Lewis and Clark's expedition.The first coin rolls out in the spring and marks the Louisiana Purchase. In 1803, Jefferson purchased land from France.That purchase doubled the size of the United States.The second coin will debut in the fall. It honors explorers Lewis and Clark and their 1804-1806 trip west to the Pacific coast of the United States.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.
3	The environment, the Earth and the universeRocks gradually wear away. This is called weathering. There are three types of weathering:Remember, when you answer questions about weathering, mention what is causing the weathering and what it does to the rock.Physical weathering is caused by physical changes such as changes in temperature, freezing and thawing, and the effects of wind, rain and waves.a little, and when a rock gets cold ita little. If a rock is heated and cooled many times, cracks form and pieces of rock fall away. This type of physical weathering happens a lot in deserts, because it is very hot during the day but very cold at night.Wind, rain and waves can all cause weathering. The wind can blow tiny grains of sand against a rock. These wear the rock away and weather it. Rain and waves can also wear away rock over long periods of time.Water expands slightly when it freezes into ice. This is why water pipes sometimes burst in the winter. You might have seen a demonstration of this sort of thing at school - a jar filled to the brim with water eventually shatters after it is put into a freezer.The formation of ice can also break rocks. If water gets into a crack in a rock and thenand pushes the crack further apart. When the ice melts later, water can get further into the crack. When the rock freezes again, it expands and makes the crack even bigger.This process of freezing and thawing can continue until the crack becomes so big that a piece of rock falls off.Water gets into a crack in a rockMore from The environment, the Earth and the universeJoin Questionaut's quest to find his friend's hat.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

2	"A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is usually easy to make. You take two slices of bread and slather peanut butter and jelly on them. But, for the U.S. Army, making the sandwich is not that easy.Some of the Army's top scientists have been trying to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for four years. The Army's sandwiches have to taste good and last for three years without refrigeration.Army scientists have already made pepperoni and barbecue chicken sandwiches. They used special chemicals to keep the sandwiches fresh.The sandwiches ""will last a minimum of three years at 80 degrees and six months at 100 degrees. They will travel to the swampiest swamp, the highest mountain, the most arid desert,"" said one army scientist.Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches pose a special problem. Mold keeps growing on them.Mold or no mold, some soldiers say the long-lasting sandwiches leave a bad taste in their mouths.

That's as heavy as a minivan!Thousands of years ago, giant creatures roamed a frozen land. Scientists recently unearthed, or dug up, fossils of some of those creatures.While working at a gravel pit in England, Ray Davies made an amazing discovery. He found the huge skull of a woolly rhino in the bucket of his digging machine. Woolly rhinos were large animals that becameAfter hearing about the discovery, scientists went to the gravel pit to get the skull. They looked in the pit for other. Fossils are ancient remains of animals and plants. Scientists found many of the rhino's other bones. ""This is the best example of a woolly rhino I have ever seen,"" said scientist Andy Currant.Scientists later found the bones of three other woolly rhinos. In addition, scientists found the bones of a woolly mammoth, bison, reindeer, wild horse, and wolf. Scientists also found the remains of insects and plants.The fossils date back to a period of time called the Ice Age. That period started almost 2 million years ago. It ended around 10,000 years ago. During the Ice Age, snow and ice covered much of Earth.At the end of the Ice Age, some animals survived. Other animals, like the woolly rhino, became extinct. The new fossils are clues to the past. They will help scientists learn more about the Ice Age.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
4	A lot of everyday items are made from polymers. Many of these polymers are not biodegradable - microbes cannot digest them and they take a long time to break down. Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.The properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex® have more useful properties than other polymers.Polymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:ethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythenea typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottlea typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packagingSome polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they areMany polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.Gore-Tex® has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex® is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.Teflon® is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex®.Gore-Tex® contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.Gore-TexÂ® fabric is a sandwich of materialsStructure and properties of polymers - higherStrong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:the strength of the forces between these moleculesA polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the material’s melting point.Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.Vulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.from 2007 about a British firm that is developing plastic electronic materials which may eventually replace silicon chips.

3	> Drama - Showing moods and emotionsBeing able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.Don't be such a drama queen!

4	Answer the questions below using information from the text and your knowledge of biology. These written materials are examples for revision practice only. They are not from any exam papers.K2 is the second highest mountain in the world at 8611m. Mountain climbers say it is even harder to climb than Mount Everest, which was climbed one year before the first successful attempt on K2.. Hypothermia and frostbite occur as the nose, fingers and toes begin to freeze. Winds can reach over 90 miles per hour and the dry air and physical exertion means that climbers can soon become dehydrated and need to drink up to six litres of water each day.Also the amount of oxygen available to breathe drops with increasing altitude. At sea level the amount of oxygen in the air is about 21% with a pressure of 760 mmHg. As altitude increases the percentage remains the same but the pressure drops. At 3000m the pressure is 540 mmHg, at 5000m it is 420 mmHg and at the top of K2 can be as low as 253 mmHg. This means there are fewer oxygen molecules per breath so the breathing rate increases to try to get more oxygen into the blood.Another problem experienced by many climbers is. Low air pressure can cause fluid to leak from the capillaries in both the lungs and the brain. This results in a build-up of fluid. As the pressure drops and the fluid build up increases, the life-threatening condition of altitude sickness occurs.Name the process by which the body keeps a constant internal environment.What happens to the air pressure as climbers go up Mount Everest?What percentage of the air is oxygen at the top of K2?Describe two effects that high altitude can have on the human body.A climber stays close to the top of K2 for two days. How much fluid are they likely to drink?Explain what happens to the body temperature when hypothermia occurs at high altitude.Explain why breathing rate increases as climbers get to higher altitudes.To the nearest whole number, calculate the percentage of oxygen molecules available in each breath to a climber on top of K2 when compared to a person at sea level.Describe the effect of cold temperatures on the skin and body of climbers.Suggest what should be done for a climber that experiences altitude sickness.Thoroughly check your answers as marks will be awarded for correct spelling, punctuation and grammar.Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

So, President Johnson ordered Operation Rolling Thunder - a massive bombing campaign against North Vietnam.He sent US troops - 500,000 by 1969 - to fight in Vietnam., the US commander, lured the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) to attack a force of American troops at, then destroyed the attackers with a massive air strike., the CIA started Operation Phoenix, arresting, interrogating and killing suspected Vietcong activists.Despite this, the Americans could not succeed in driving the Vietcong out of the rural areas, capturing a number of towns in South Vietnam.The North Vietnamese lost 58,000 men, including many officers. Their morale was damaged - the offensive proved that they could not defeat the Americans by direct attack.It took the Americans a month to recover the towns. Their confidence was badly shaken. They won the Tet Offensive, but realised that they would never defeat the Vietcong.A type of warfare that uses unusual tactics, and in-depth knowledge of local surroundings, to defeat opponents both physically and psychologically., ambushing US patrols, setting booby traps and landmines, and planting bombs in towns. They mingled in with the peasants, wearing ordinary clothes. The Americans couldn't identify who the enemy was.They were supplied with rockets and weapons by China and Russia. They used the Ho Chi Minh Trail - a jungle route through Laos and Cambodia - to supply their armies. The Americans couldn't attack their supply routes without escalating the war.of the Americans - staying so close to the Americans so they could not use air or artillery backup without killing their own men., using B52 bombers, artillery, helicopters, napalm and defoliants (Agent Orange). This killed many innocent civilians, and failed to stop the Vietcong guerrillas.They forced the peasants to leave Vietcong-controlled areas and made them live in defendedin loyal areas. This created immense opposition, and allowed Vietcong infiltrators into loyal areas.American troops were sent on patrols, then supported by air and artillery when attacked. This demoralised the soldiers, who realised they were being used just as bait.patrols went out looking for ""Charlie"", as they called the Vietcong.

They believed the huge meat-eating dinosaur, also known as, could run as fast as 40 miles per hour (about the speed of a car). Thanks to the latest technology,Carl Mehling knows that isn't true. A paleontologist studies dinosaurs.With the click of the mouse, a computer shows Mehling that it would be impossible for the giant dinosaur to run that fast because of its size. ""The power of some of these computers is far beyond what scientists could figure out on paper just a few years ago,"" Mehling told. ""The computers answer questions we wouldn't even have thought of asking."" Now, ""Dinosaurs,"" an exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City (where Mehling works), explores the modern world of paleontology.In the past, scientists relied only onto learn about dinosaurs. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals from long ago. When a plant or an animal dies, it usually rots away. However, if it is buried quickly by mud or sand, parts of it may be preserved. Over millions of years the remains can turn into a fossil. Fossils can be bones, teeth, footprints, or nests of eggs.When a dinosaur fossil is found, scientists carefully dig around it and study it. They photograph, measure, and record each bone's position. Then the bones are dug up and often taken to a museum where the fossil is rebuilt.Today, advanced technology allows paleontologists to examine fossils in fresh ways. By creating computer models, scientists can tell how bones fit together and how these ancient creatures moved.used its long neck to munch on tall treetops. Their new model reveals that the huge plant-eating dinosaur most likely bent its neck downward to eat low shrubs and plants.fossil was discovered by Barnum Brown in 1902 in Montana, long after these ancient creatures roamed Earth. Dinosaurs first appeared on Earth 245 million years ago, during the Mesozoic Era. They died about 65 million years ago.What caused dinosaurs to become extinct? Scientists don't know for sure, but they have differentor possible explanations. One theory is that a huge asteroid or comet struck Earth. The collision likely filled the air with a huge cloud of dust and blocked out most of the sun's light and heat. As a result, many plants and animals would have died out.In addition to using computers to study dinosaurs, scientists also use special X-ray machines to look inside fossils. They hope that new technology may one day answer ancient mysteries like what color dinosaurs might have been.""Every time a new technique comes up, the old fossils are pulled out again and looked at anew with brand-new eyes,"" Mehling says. ""It's cool.""By studying fossils and using high-tech computer programs, scientists are learning more than ever about dinosaurs.The skull of this domeheaded dinosaur might have been used to help members of the same species recognize each other.Computer models show that the dinosaur's neck curved downward and couldn't have been raised as high as scientists once thought.stood upright and dragged its tail along the ground.

A recent study shows that lugging around a bulky backpack that doesn't fit correctly can lead to poorIf someone tells you that good posture is important, that person is referring to the position of your body when you stand, sit, or walk. Carrying around too much weight in your backpack can force you to bend forward. Slouching over can round your shoulders and cause your upper back to curve.Over time, the extra stress on your back can create posture problems. Some doctors think those problems may lead to neck and back pain.Thirteen children, ages 8 and 9, participated in the backpack study. They walked about 1,130 feet. That is about the average length of a child's walk to school. The kids walked with backpacks that weighed 9 to 13 pounds. The children also walked without backpacks.The study's researchers found that the heavier the backpack load, the more children bent down to support its weight. Afterward, some kids complained that their lower backs and shoulders hurt.Heidi Orloff, one of the researchers, said that she could tell when the backpacks were too heavy or the kids were tired. ""The kids' chins drop to their chests,"" she toldAn estimated 40 million school-age children in the United States use backpacks. Some health groups say that more than half of those students may be carrying backpacks heavy enough to affect their posture.When worn correctly, backpacks have many benefits. They have lots of compartments that help you stay organized. Compared with shoulder bags, backpacks are a better way to carry around the items you need for school. Your body's strongest muscles-in the back and stomach-support the weight of a backpack. A shoulder bag often puts strain unevenly on your body.However, most health experts recommend that kids carry backpacks that are no more than 15 percent of their body weight. That means a 70-pound student should wear a backpack that weighs less than 10 1/2 pounds. Orloff also said that spot checks around the country show that many children are carrying backpacks that weigh between 20 and 25 pounds. Now, that's quite a burden!Below, you'll find some tips to help ease your load. Your back will thank you!Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.Use both shoulder straps and fasten the waist strap to balance the weight evenly.Adjust the shoulder straps so that the backpack is close to your body.Pack only what you need and place the heaviest items closest to the center of your back.What are other ways you can help improve your posture?That means you should bend at the knees when you pick up your backpack.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

4	Treatment of disease was a hit-or-miss affair in Medieval Europe. You might get offered a hot bath to balance your 'natural heat', a prayer said over your bad tooth, or a leech clamped to your skin., and knowledge was in short supply. Nevertheless, doctors were learning to be more observant of people's symptoms - the first step to treating sickness.Many Medieval doctors carried with them a(meaning 'Go-with-me') book of diagnoses and a. Usually, they examined the colour, smell and taste of the patient's urine, and made an on-the-spot guess as to what they might be suffering from. Pictures from the time make it clear that doctors also did clinical observation, and took their patient's pulse.. Since they believed that bad smells carried disease, they believed that they could protect themselves from catching the disease by carrying something nice-smelling.Since they still believed in the theory of theFour bodily fluids - yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm - used in ancient times to analyse and describe people's state of health., many of their cures involved balancing the 'humours overflowing'. They did this by bleeding, applying leeches, or causing purging or vomiting in their patients. Other ways of balancing the 'natural heat' included the taking of hot baths, drinking a soup of yellow lentils, or applying water cooled with snow.Medieval apothecary brewing one of his medicinesThe Medieval English poet Chaucer describes how a doctor was followed by a 'tribe' of apothecaries (medicine-makers), and it is known that medieval doctors had access to a huge range ofand substances. These included red rose ground fine with 'bamboo juice' for smallpox, and fig poultices for plague sores.throughout the period. Monarchs thought that by touching patients suffering from the 'King's Evil' (scrofula) they could cure them. Peasants prayed to St Roch to cure their toothache or the plague, or turned to St Anthony to cure them of 'St Anthony's Fire' (ergotism).During the time of the plague, huge Christian processions were held, at which people flagellated (whipped) themselves, to try to show God how sorry they were for their sins.Source A - Johannes de Mirfield on a medicinal bathMirfield, a monk and a doctor, was regarded as one of the best doctors of his time.Here is a bath which has proved to be of value. Take blind puppies, gut them, and cut off the feet; then boil in water, and in this water let the patient bathe himself. Let him get in the bath for four hours after he has eaten, and whilst in the bath he should keep his head covered, and his chest completely covered with the skin of a goat, so he won't catch a sudden chill.Johannes de Mirfield, 'Flowers of Bartholomew' (c.1375)Source B - Guy de Chauliac on reducing swellingBleeding and purging, cordials and medicinal powders can be used. The swellings should be softened with figs and cooked onions, peeled and mixed with yeast and butter, then lanced and treated like ulcers.Source C - John of Gaddesden on toothacheJohn of Gaddesden claimed to be an expert doctor, but most of his cures relied on 'sympathetic' magic, and he clearly knew little about surgery.When the gospel for Sunday is read during the service of the Mass, let the man hearing Mass sign his tooth and his head with the sign of the Holy Cross and say the Lord's Prayer. It will keep him from pain and cure the tooth, so say trustworthy doctors.What can the sources tell historians about the treatment of disease in Medieval times?There is evidence of a belief in the curative powers of:the balancing of 'natural heat' (Mirfield's medicinal bath)all manner of natural substances (figs, blind puppies)Note that Gaddesden accepts the authority of other 'trustworthy' doctors.

In 1981, O’Connor became the first woman in history to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.Bush had first nominated Harriet Miers, a White House lawyer, to take O’Connor’s place. However, Miers withdrew her nomination after coming under fire partly for a lack of experience. Miers had never been a judge. O’Connor is serving on the Supreme Court until a replacement is confirmed.Alito grew up in New Jersey in a family that valued learning. Both of his parents were teachers. He has argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court, losing just two.As a federal judge, Alito has also served on a lower court for the past 15 years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With 29 years of legal experience, Bush says, Alito ""has more prior judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years.""To become a Supreme Court justice, a nominee must be approved by the Senate.

Concentrate on what you do understand, not on the difficult words and phrases.Have a good look at the title of the text as well as any illustrations. They may give you some important clues.Read the whole text before attempting to answer any questions. It is usually better to read the text twice at a brisk pace, than to struggle along once, slowly.Be clear as to exactly what each question wants. For example, should you be picking out precise details (for example, the date of someone's birthday) or should you be reading the whole passage in order to draw some broad conclusions (for example, a comparison of two people's attitudes to television)?Be aware of different ways of finding out the meaning of words. For example:Can you guess the meaning of a difficult word in a sentence if you understand what all the other words mean?Can you find similarities between Spanish and English words? (egCan you find links with other Spanish words? (egAre you aware of language patterns? (eg 're' in front of a word often means again:Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, if you can identify a plural, a verb tense, an adjective, an adverb or a preposition, you will be in a better position to make an intelligent guess at a meaning.Use your knowledge of Spain and Spanish-speaking countries. For example, knowing about the Spanish educational system could be very useful if you are working on a text about school.If you have to write answers in Spanish, be as clear as possible; but remember you willDon't spend too long on a difficult item.

The scientists are using the machine to study Native American arrowheads and other stone tools.What makes the scientists' work so special is that the machine does not harm the objects. In the past, scientists had to drill holes or take samples from. Artifacts are objects made by people in the past.The machine can tell the scientists what the objects are made of. That can help them learn where the rocks used to make the tools came from. For example, the scientists figured out that tools found in Alaska were made from rocks 300 miles away.Scientists hope to use the machine to learn more about other ancient cultures.

Stars like our Sun will change to:6.2 billion years from now the Sun will have become a red giant starStars that are much heavier than our Sun have a different fate. A heavy-weight star will still become a red giant. But then:it blows apart in a huge explosion called a supernova.the central part left behind forms a neutron star, or even a black hole, if it is heavy enough.black holes have a large mass, and a large gravity.

4	All animals and plants are made of cells. Animal cells and plant cells have features in common, such as a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria and ribosomes. Plant cells also have a cell wall, and often have chloroplasts and a permanent vacuole. Note that cells may be specialised to carry out a particular function.Dissolved substances pass into and out of cells by diffusion. Water passes into and out of cells by osmosis.Function of cells which animal and plant cells have in commoncontains genetic material, which controls the activities of the cellmost chemical processes take place here, controlled by enzymescontrols the movement of substances into and out of the cellmost energy is released by respiration herecontain chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy for photosynthesisfilled with cell sap to help keep the cellhaving turgor; enlarged and swollen with waterMake sure you can label diagrams of animal and plant cells, like these:Cells may be specialised for a particular function. Their structure will allow them to carry this function out. Here are some examples:Packed with chloroplasts. Regular shaped, closely packed cells form a continuous layer for efficient absorption of sunlight.Absorbs water and mineral ions from the soilLong 'finger-like' process with very thin wall, which gives a large surface area.Fertilises an egg cell - female gameteThe head contains genetic information and an enzyme to help penetrate the egg cell membrane. The middle section is packed with mitochondria for energy. The tail moves the sperm to the egg.Contain haemoglobin to carry oxygen to the cells.Thin outer membrane to let oxygen diffuse through easily. Shape increases the surface area to allow more oxygen to be absorbed efficiently. No nucleus, so the whole cell is full of haemoglobin.You are likely to be given information, perhaps in a diagram, to help you to explain the adaptations of a particular cell type to its function.Dissolved substances have to pass through the cell membrane to get into or out of a cell. Diffusion is one of the processes that allows this to happen.The movement of particles (molecules or ions) from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentrationoccurs when particles spread. They move from a region where they are in high concentration to a region where they are in low concentration. Diffusion happens when the particles are free to move. This is true in gases and for particles dissolved in solutions. Particles diffuse down a concentration gradient, from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This is how the smell of cooking travels around the house from the kitchen, for example.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

For osmosis to happen you need:a partially permeable membrane to separate themPartially permeable membranes let some substances pass through them, but not others. The animation shows an example of osmosis.Osmosis is the movement of water from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated solution through a partially permeable membrane.This is shown in the animation above. Eventually the level on the more concentrated side of the membrane rises, while the one on the less concentrated side falls. When the concentration is the same on both sides of the membrane, the movement of water molecules will be the same in both directions. At this point, the net exchange of water is zero and there is no further change in the liquid levels.Osmosis is important to plants. They gain water by osmosis through their roots. Water moves into plant cells by osmosis, making themhaving turgor; enlarged and swollen with wateror stiff so they that able to hold the plant upright.

Consequently, they distrusted and feared them, and could believe anything (including torture and deceit) of a people they did not understand. Conversely, the Native Americans felt that white Americans were devils who ruined the earth. Differences of culture caused them to hate and despise each other, and led to war.The wars might be seen as the. The white settlers believed that the Native Americans were inferior. They felt justified in saying that 'complete extermination is our motto', and in slaughtering the buffalo to starve the Native Americans to death. In 1864, Colonel Chivington justified the massacre at Sand Creek by saying:""Kill them all, big and little: nits make lice"", Native Americans had nothing to lose - as the Sioux Chief Gall said:""You fought me and I had to fight back""It could be argued that war broke out simply because the white men wanted the Great Plains - firstly to cross, then for gold, then for cattle and then for farming.

People use science to try to understand those mysteries.The pyramids are giant tombs, or graves, for Egyptian kings. Pyramids are made of huge stone blocks. Experts know that the Egyptians didn't have the same tools that we have today. So, how were those heavy blocks moved and lifted? Some experts believe that the Egyptians pushed and pulled them into place.1. Workers cut and shaped the stone into blocks.2. The workers floated the blocks down the Nile River on big barges.3. The workers rolled the blocks over logs from the river to the pyramid.4. The workers built dirt ramps so the blocks could be rolled to the top of the pyramid.5. Workers carefully fit the stone blocks into place on the pyramid.No one knows for sure what the dinosaurs looked like. Some experts think that dinosaur skin might have looked and felt like the scaly skin of reptiles today.Experts study how animals today use skin color to survive. Some animals, like the chameleon, can change skin color in order to hide. Experts also say that other animals, like poison arrow frogs, have brightly colored skin to keep away their enemies.It is likely that dinosaurs also used skin color to survive, say experts.

3	Ratios are used in everyday life and can help you work out problems including scale drawings and reading maps.In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion.A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on.a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:b) 20cm on the boat = 1cm on the modelso mast height on real boat ÷ 20 = mast height on model400cm (4m) on the boat = 400cm ÷ 20 =Maps scales can be written in ratios and tell you how many units of land, sea etc are equal to one unit on the map.If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.To convert from m to km divide by 1000.The scale of a map is 1:50 000.

The rate of synthesis reactions needs to be controlled so that the product is produced as quickly (therefore cheaply) and safely as possible.In the exam you will be expected to give examples of reactions with different rates and to explain how the rate of a reaction could be measured.. Reactions that happen slowly have arate of reaction and reactions that happen quickly have arate of reaction. For example, the chemicalof rocks is a very slow reaction: it has arate of reaction. Explosions are very fast reactions: they have aThe rate of a reaction can be measured by either:substances present at the start of a chemical reactionA product is a substance formed in a chemical reaction.The formation of product or consumption of reactant could be measured by observing a change of colour or the formation of a precipitate. Sometimes it is easier to measure the change in the amount of a reactant that has been used up, and sometimes it is easier to measure the change in the amount of a product that has been produced.The measurement itself depends upon the nature of the reactant or product:The mass of a substance (solid, liquid or gas) is measured with a balance.The volume of a gas is usually measured with a gas syringe, or sometimes with an upside down measuring cylinder or burette.It is usual to record the mass or total volume at regular intervals and to plot aIn the exam you will need to know the factors that affect the rate of reactions, and how to plot or interpret graphs from rate experiments.The above graph summarises the differences in the rate of reaction at different temperatures, concentrations and size of solid pieces.

But only a small number of these collisions lead to the formation of product. For a collision to be ‘successful’, the particles involved must possess enough energy, called the, to break some of the existing bonds.Any change that increases the number of collisions per second, or increases the energy of the particles that are colliding, willIf the temperature is increased, there will be more energy in the collisions. More collisions will have the activation energy, resulting in an increase in the rate of reaction.If the concentration of one or more of the reactants is increased, there will be more collisions per second, resulting in an increase in the rate of reaction.
0	Summer is almost here! Why do experts say that summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids? During the summer, most schools are closed. Kids have more time to play outside, ride bikes, and swim. That means kids have more chances to get hurt.Playing outside gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, but it also exposes you to harmful sun rays. Harmful sun rays can cause sunburns. You can get a sunburn even if you are outside for a short amount of time. So when you are in the sun, always wear sunscreen. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, and be sure to rub it evenly into your skin. You should also wear a hat and try to play in the shade.Whether you ride a bike, ride a scooter, or use in-line skates, be wheel safe. The most serious way kids get hurt while on wheels is by hitting their heads. So always wear a helmet when you are playing on wheels. When you ride scooters and use in-line skates, always wear wrist guards, kneepads, and elbow pads.What's the Right Way to Wear a Helmet?A helmet should be straight on the head, just above the eyebrows.The chin strap should be snug but not too tight.The rear straps go behind the ears; the front straps should run up and down.One way to beat the summer heat is by swimming in a cool pool. To stay safe when you swim, you need to follow water-safety rules. Be water safe by swimming only when a grown-up is nearby. You should always swim with a buddy.How else can you be safe this summer?All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

4	Nanoparticles range in size from 100 nm to 1 nm and are far too small to see with a microscope. They have remarkable properties that are different from the same substance in bulk. They are already being used in consumer products but there are some uncertainties about their safety.The table shows some of the units used for measuring length. As you go down the table, each unit is one thousand times smaller than the one above it.Some of the units used for measuring lengthNanotubes like this could be used to make tiny mechanical devices, molecular computers or extremely strong materialsNanoparticles range in size from about 100 nm down to about 1 nm. They are typically the size of small molecules and are far too small to see with a microscope.Nanoparticles are so small that they have different properties than the same substance in normal-sized pieces. For example, pieces of gold are, fairly obviously, gold-coloured. But gold nanoparticles are deep red or even black when mixed with water. Such different properties are very useful.Titanium dioxide is a white solid used in house paint and certain candy-coated chocolates. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are so small that they do not reflect visible light, so they cannot be seen. They are used in sunblock creams because they block harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun without appearing white on the skin.Some cosmetics contain 'liposomes', which are fatty nanoparticles. Liposomes also have great potential in the pharmaceutical industry, as they can deliver tiny doses of medicines direct to cells.Since the properties of a given nanoparticle are not easily predicted by studying the substance from which it is made, there are worries that nanoparticles may have undiscovered side-effects.Nanoparticles have a very large surface area compared to their volume, so they are often able to react very quickly. This makes them useful as catalysts to speed up reactions. For example, they can be used in self-cleaning ovens and windows. However, there is also the possibility that they might speed up reactions in living things in unpredictable ways, perhaps causing illness or death.

Although November may seem like a long way off to you, it's not for the presidential. Those are the people who are running for the chance to be elected president.Every four years, Americans vote for the president of the United States. This year, Election Day takes place on November 2.During the past months, candidates have been busy gearing up for the election. They have been giving speeches, participating in debates, meeting voters, and advertising on television and radio.January is especially important in the election process because it marks the first. Those are special elections in which people vote for the person they want as their party's candidate for president., or groups, in the United States. They are the Democratic party and the Republican party. Members of the Democratic party are called Democrats. Members of the Republican party are called Republicans.At press time, nine Democrats want to be chosen as their party's presidential candidate. The Democrat who wins will run against President George W. Bush. Bush is a member of the Republican party and is campaigning for re-election.Winning primaries and caucuses is important to candidates. A win means a candidate has a state's support at the party's national convention later in the year. At this year's convention, the Democrats will, or choose, a candidate to run against President Bush.Some political polls, which survey people's opinions, show that Howard Dean is considered the leader among the Democrats who hope to run against Bush on Election Day. Dean is a former governor of Vermont.Massachusetts Senator John Kerry is also running. He pointed out to, ""The race is not over until all the votes have been cast and counted.""In the end, the American people will choose the next president on Election Day.

While on the campaign trail, the buses will make stops at schools.How Will Saddam's Capture Affect the Election?The nearly nine-month manhunt for Saddam Hussein ended on December 13. That is when U.S. troops captured the former Iraqi leader hiding in a 6-foot by 8-foot hole near his hometown, just north of Baghdad.The situation in Iraq will be one of the main, or concerns, that candidates will address in this year's election. Many people wonder what effect Saddam's capture will have on the election.Some people think that his capture might give President Bush an advantage. Others aren't so sure. They think that Bush's popularity will drop if violence continues in Iraq. ""The capture of Saddam is good news for the people of Iraq and the world,"" said Democratic presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun. ""But it does not change the fact that our troops remain in harm's way, and we are no closer to bringing them home.""What qualities do you think are important in a president?The Republicans hope Saddam's capture will lead to more votes for Bush.

But how do animals stay warm in Antarctica?Antarctica is a big icy continent. It is around the South Pole. The South Pole is found at the bottom of Earth.Penguins are birds. Emperor and Adelie penguins live in Antarctica. The penguins stay warm because they have feathers that are very small and close together. The feathers have oil on them. Cold water can't get through the feathers to touch the penguins' skin. Each year, penguins molt, or lose, their feathers and grow new ones.Penguins can waddle faster than humans can walk.Penguins like to line up and dive into the water again and again.Penguins sometimes toboggan, or slide, on their bellies.Penguins surf waves to get back to shore.Weddell seals live in Antarctica. Weddell seals swim in the cold ocean water to catch fish and other ocean animals to eat. These seals don't chew their food.

The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off.

Most mains powered appliances need three wires to work safely: live, neutral and earth.Resistance (measured in Ohms) is a measure of how hard it is for a current to flow through a circuit component. The size of the current flowing depends on the potential difference (voltage) driving it and the amount of resistance it has to flow through.In order to flow, an electric current needs:something to push the current around the circuitYour web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment.

2	"If you had to choose one invention you couldn't live without, which would it be-the toothbrush, car, cell phone, or microwave oven? That was the question asked of American teens and adults in a survey conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).The toothbrush emerged as the number-one invention that Americans can't live without. Following closely in second place was the car.These findings show that important inventions do not have to be complicated. ""In today's high-tech society, we thought people would be voting for the high-tech inventions,"" said Kristin Joyce, a spokesperson at MIT. ""The results show that simple, low-tech inventions are important to people.""The toothbrush has a long history, dating back to the 15th century. According to the American Dental Association, the first toothbrush was invented in 1498. To make the brush, a Chinese emperor placed hog bristles in a bone handle.In 1938, nylon bristles replaced pig bristles. Dentists today are eager to remind people that while the toothbrush has taken the throne as king of the invention list, it still needs its handy sidekick-dental floss.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

3	> Inform, explain and describe - ExplainingWhen you explain, you don't just write information - you also need to give. In very basic terms you can think of the difference between informing and explaining in terms of answering a slightly different set of questions:Explain = What? When? Who? Where? How? Why?This difference is reflected in the question you will be asked, so our question about the leaflet might look a little different now:Write a leaflet for both the pupils and their parents, outlining some of the main features of school life in Year 7 and beyond. In particular, explain why pupils have several teachers each day and why the detention system is used.This is a little harder than the earlier version, but it's still about your school. Therefore, you still need lots of information about the classes, the organisation and the timetable. So you could still use our two basic approaches, timelines and topic centres, like this:However, you can also put these together, like this:Now, we can see a number of topics, so perhaps the three big circles represent registration, lesson times and detentions. They occur in that order each day, but the reasons for them are very different. So the smaller circles answer how and why as well as what, when and who. For instance, what are detentions? When do they take place? Who is in charge of them? How do pupils get put in detention? Why does the school use detentions?This approach gives your answer a very clear structure. The writing deals with a number of subjects in turn and each subject should be in its own paragraph. You can add details and explanations as you write out each paragraph. It makes it easier for you to write and easier for your audience to read or listen to.More than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

2	Wispy lights danced through the night sky in October. Observers worldwide saw the lights.People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color.are also called the northern lights and southern lights.Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun.If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops.Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

2	"It was a clear evening on July 23 as James Mennig stood outside his home in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. As he looked up into the sky, Mennig saw something that caused him to turn and run inside.Mennig saw a bright object streak through the sky. ""It looked like a plane that was totally engulfed in flames,"" he said.The flaming object Mennig saw was not a burning plane. It was a meteor burning up in Earth's atmosphere.A meteor is a piece of rock or metal from space that burns up as it streaks through Earth's atmosphere. Because meteors look like stars falling or streaking across the sky, many people call them shooting stars.According to officials at the U.S. Department of Defense, the bright meteor, which is called a fireball, entered Earth's atmosphere above Scranton, Pa. People from Canada to Virginia saw the bright fireball.Scientists said the meteor exploded somewhere near Williamsport, Pa. No one was hurt by the fireball and no homes were damaged. But eyewitnesses later described a layer of gray ash and damaged plants in a cornfield.According to scientists, meteors streak through Earth's atmosphere every day, but most burn up before hitting the ground. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now studying ways to prevent large meteors from hitting Earth.Observers not only saw the fireball, they heard it as well. As the fireball raced through the atmosphere, it produced a loud noise.""There were two monstrous booms followed by a long rumbling and this great shaking. It knocked pictures off walls,"" said Anna Jean Edkin, a safety official in Anthony Township, Pa.*Meteors come from pieces of space debris called meteoroids. Meteoroids can be made of rock, metal, or both.*A meteor is a piece of rock or metal that breaks away from a meteoroid and enters Earth's atmosphere.*A meteorite is a meteor that falls through Earth's atmosphere and hits the planet.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

3	> Disease - Microbes - useful or not?Disease - Microbes - useful or not?People often use the word germ instead of microbe, so you might think that microbes are all harmful. But some are useful to us.Yeast cells are useful to bakers and brewers. Yeast cells can change sugar into carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. This is useful to bakers because the gas helps the bread rise, and it is useful to brewers because it adds the alcohol needed for their drinks.Bacteria are also useful to us. For example, certain bacteria cause the changes needed in milk to make yogurt and cheese out of it.Many microbes can cause diseases. For example here are some diseases caused by fungi:Here are some diseases caused by bacteria:Here are some diseases caused by viruses:Microbes cause disease when they are able to reproduce in the body. They produce harmful substances called, and damage tissues and organs. We say that someone who has harmful disease-causing microbes in them is infected.Use your knowledge to help Spherox find his way home.More than 3000 video clips from BBC programmes.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

2	"Most students spend their school days sitting at desks learning. Aurelious Woolfolk, however, does a lot more than sit at a desk when he is in school. He scrambles up high ladders, walks down the sides of buildings, and rides in a fire engine. He is learning to be a firefighter at the New Haven Fire Academy.Woolfolk and 28 other students are currently learning what it takes to become a firefighter. Classes at the fire academy, which is in Connecticut, last for about 22 weeks. On most days, the students go to school from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. However, once a week, school lasts until 10 p.m.For two days each week, the students sit in a classroom to learn science, math, and emergency medicine. They learn the science of fires, how to calculate water pressure, and how to treat medical emergencies.During the other three days, the students go outside and learn how to hook hoses to fire hydrants, climb buildings, rescue people trapped in burning buildings, and many other things.""Firefighters have to know lots of different things,"" said Pablo Menendez, an instructor at the school. ""We have to treat medical emergencies, know how to handle dangerous chemicals, and rescue people who have fallen from cliffs.""Teamwork is one of the most important lessons students learn at the school. ""Working together saves lives,"" said Capt. William Seward, the director of the academy. ""Students need to learn that they are part of a team.""Fighting fires is not easy. The suits and equipment a firefighter wears weigh about 40 pounds.Firefighters are very busy. In New Haven, they respond to 32,000 emergency calls a year. Each time firefighters go out, they know they might not come back. Across the United States, about 100 firefighters die each year.""That's why the lessons learned here at the academy are so important,"" said Seward. ""What they learn here can save their lives.""Firefighters know how dangerous their jobs are. Their training helps them overcome their fear of heights and fires. ""When you're up there on the ladder looking down, it's scary,"" said one student. ""To do this job, you've got to wipe out the fear.""Firefighters overcome their fear for one reason. ""I wanted to help other people,"" said Leah Harwin.

4	If it was a Serbian who shot an Austrian, why did Germany, Russia, France and Britain become embroiled in a war? The European countries became involved in the war because of thethey had formed with each other - they had promised to support each other in the event of war and war was upon them.This list of dates shows how Europe slid into war after the murder of Franz Ferdinand.The Austrian government asks the German government if it will support Austria in a war against Russia, if Russia supports Serbia. The Germans say they will support whatever the Austrian government decides to do - the so called 'blank cheque'.The Austrian government sends the Serbian government an ultimatum.The Serbians accept all the conditions except one - that Austrian police should be allowed into Serbia.Germany declares war on France and, following the Schlieffen Plan, attacks Belgium.Britain keeps the promise made in a treaty of 1839 to defend Belgium, and declares war on Germany.The powder-keg was already full. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand put the match to it by giving Austria the opportunity she was determined to take, of crushing Serbia in war. The Austrian ultimatum sent to Serbia (July 23) was followed within five days by a declaration of war against Serbia in spite of the conciliatory answer given by the Serbs.The Austrians were determined on war and the Germans made no effort to stop them. Russian mobilisation (July 30) was followed by German mobilisation. Germany declared war on Russia (August 1) and on France (August 3). The German ultimatum to Belgium, demanding free passage for German troops through Belgium, brought in Britain on August 4, 1914.PJ Larkin, European History for Certificate Classes (1965). (An old school pupils' examination revision book.)Look at Source A and Source B and think about the key dates involved in the steps to war.Compare the key dates carefully with the details of the textbook account (Source A), listing the points at which the key dates supports or contradicts the textbook.Compare the key dates with the details of the cartoon (Source B), listing the points at which the key dates supports or contradicts the cartoon.The cartoon shows what the nations were committed to each other by their treaty alliances in July 1914. However, it does not describe the actual events accurately. Although in the event Austria did attack Serbia, Russia did mobilise against Austria, and Germany did attack Russia, the cartoon is incorrect to show France and Britain then attacking Germany France came into the war because Germany declared war on it, and Britain came into the war to defend Belgium, not Russia.for 'all the loss and damage' of the war.During the 1920s, however, Germans vigorously denied this, and - during the period ofThe policy of pacifying an aggressor through giving in to their demands, thus maintaining peace.in the 1930s - many people were prepared toSydney Bradshaw Fay laid the emphasis on theThe British prime minister Lloyd George blamed the war on thewho, he said, lacked the ability to negotiate their way out of war.After the Second World War, historians were. In the 1960s, the German historian Fritz Fischer argued that the German leaders had a 'will to war', that they wanted to expand German power, and they wanted the situation in Europe to deteriorate into war. This is the view still held by many historians today.Look back through the pages in this topic - International relations: the First World War - sorting the evidence that suggests:that Germany played a significant part in causing the First World War.that Germany's role was just one factor among many.You will find that there is evidence forAs part of your revision, think about thethe assassination of Franz Ferdinand led to the outbreak of war in 1914.role Kaiser Wilhelm II played in the development of hostility in Europe.

The mother cheetah does not know it, but animal experts are tracking her every move.Most wild cheetahs live in Africa. Animal experts are worried that cheetahs are in danger of disappearing from parts of Africa. One wildlife group in South Africa is trying to protect these big cats.The group is working to find out how many cheetahs are left in South Africa and where they roam. To track the animals, they use radio collars, cameras, and aircraft. Experts will use what they learn to find ways to save cheetahs.The biggest threat to cheetahs comes from people. They have built farms on land where the animals live. As farming areas spread, cheetahs often have trouble finding food. In addition, farmers who want to protect their animals sometimes kill cheetahs.The good news is that there still is hope for cheetahs. The group is helping to move cheetahs away from the farms to other areas in the wild.""Cheetahs are very, very special,"" said the group's director. ""It would be a great shame if a time came when our children and our children's children were not able to see the cheetah.""Cheetahs can run 65 miles per hour. That is about as fast as a car driving on a highway!In one second, cheetahs can run about 92 feet.Cheetahs can run fast for only a short distance about a quarter of a mile.Why should people help animals that are in danger?All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
4	Probability is about estimating how likely (probable) something is to happen. Probability can be used to predict, for example, the outcome when throwing a die or tossing a coin.We often use words to describe how probable we think it is that an event will take place. For example, we might say that it is likely to be sunny tomorrow, or that it is unlikely to snow in August.Have a look at the statements below, and decide whether the following events are:You buy a lottery ticket and win the jackpot.You toss a coin and get heads.Christmas will fall on 25 December this year.It will rain in the first week of December.A game is played where 7 beads with digits from 1 to 7 on them are placed in a bag, a bead is taken out, and you then have to guess whether the number on the next one to be taken out will beIn each case, choose an appropriate word from the following list to complete each sentence:Remember that there is only one of each number., what is the chance of the 2nd bead being, what is the chance of the 3rd bead being, what is the chance of the next bead beingWhat is the chance of the next bead beingThe numbers remaining are: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1.So the chance of the 2nd bead being less than 7 isThe numbers remaining are: 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.The chance of the next bead beingThe numbers remaining are: 2, 3, 4 and 5.The chance of the next bead being higher than 4 is', and so on, may not mean the same to everyone. We need to be more precise about how likely something (an outcome) is to happen. The probability of an outcome can have any value between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). It may be a fraction, decimal or percentage.When different outcomes of an event are equally likely (for example, getting a head when you toss a coin), you can use a formula to calculate the probability of outcomes.When you throw a fair dice there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. There are three ways of getting an odd number (1, 3 or 5).So the probability of getting an odd number =the number of ways of getting an odd number ÷ total number of possible outcomes =The table below gives some examples of events and how their probability can be calculated.Number of ways to get this outcomeChoosing a playing card from a full pack without lookingChoosing a playing card from a full pack without lookingYou may sometimes need to list all the possible outcomes of an event. The key is to work systematically - do not just list all the outcomes randomly. Here is an example:Imagine that you had to find all the different orders in which three people (Anita, Benita and Carol) could finish in a race.The first step (to save you writing too much) is to label the people A, B and C - but make sure you mention this. Jot down the different orders in which Anita, Benita and Carol could finish.Make sure you can 'see' the pattern in the order of choices.Here are two fair spinners. The total score is the sum of the two numbers the arrows point to.Your web browser does not have JavaScript switched on at the moment. For information on how to enable JavaScript please go to theYou will not be able to see this content until you have JavaScript switched on.Jot down, systematically, all the possible outcomes for the two spinners. You will find it useful to use a table of results, as shown.Use the table to answer these questions:How many different possible outcomes are there?12. All you have to do is count the number of entries in the table.How many outcomes gave a total score of 2?Only 2 outcomes give a total score of 2: a '1' on each spinner, or a '2' on the triangular spinner and '0' on the square one.What is the probability of getting a total score of 2?The number of outcomes giving a total score of 2 ÷ the total number of outcomes =How many outcomes gave a total score of 4?What is the probability of getting a total score of 4?The number of outcomes giving a total score of 4 ÷ the total number of outcomes =You can estimate probabilities from an experiment. These are sometimes called experimental probabilities.For example, in an experiment where you drop a drawing pin:The total number of throws is 1000.So the probability of the drawing pin landing up is:The number of times this outcome occurs (pin up) ÷ total number of outcomes (or trials) =
4	"This exercise will help you practise writing to describe a new friend.Writing question: Description of a new friendRead this typical exam question and think about how you would answer it. You can write your answer on paper.You have just met a new friend in the Gaeltacht. Write a letter to your family telling them about her. Include the following information. (approx. 90-100 words).Give details of two things you did at the weekendMention something you will both do when you return homeNow read through the model answer written by Áine. It contains no mistakes.Tá súil agam go bhfuil tú go maith. Bhuail mé le cara nua anseo. Tá sí ag stopadh sa teach liom. Róisín Ní Cheallaigh an t-ainm atá uirthi.Tá sí measartha ard agus tá a cuid gruaige donn, fada agus catach. Tá a súile donn.

San oíche, chuaigh muid chuig dioscó sa choláiste - bhí craic ar dóigh againn!Rachaidh muid chuig ceolchoirm i mBéal Feirste sa samhradh.A good piece of writing at this level will:Think about why Áine's answer is good. Compare your answer with hers and then move on to the next page to see the teacher's view.Here are the teacher's comments. The teacher is looking for answers that make sense and give all the information asked for, with some development of tasks to reach the required word limit. Correct use of tenses is important as well.Firstly, Áine is writing a letter, so she needs to lay it out properly. She did this - giving an address, an opening and a closing statement. She then goes about fulfilling the main tasks - developing answers where appropriate.She tells her mother she has met a new friend and that she is staying in the same house with her. Always use the prepositionif you want to say you met someone eg.' by itself means to hit! She then says what her friend looks like. When asked to describe other people, take care with possessive adjectivesmo (my) do (your) a (his) a (her)- he is. Don't get these mixed up. Áine used a nice adjectiveÁine gave some nice information about her friend.- She likes. It is important to be able to use this structure correctly for different people.... - She is interested in ... It is worth learning off how to use this for different people.Give details of two things you did at the weekendMake sure that in your writing, the language used is appropriate to the task eg. the activities Áine mentioned are very relevant to being in the Gaeltacht. It would not be appropriate to say they had gone shopping in the city centre, for example. Áine used the past tense correctly.Mention something you will both do when you return homeÁine mentioned something they would do when they came back, correctly using the future tense.You could plan your answer - writing a brief diagram or plan first will help focus your ideas.Think about material you have prepared for your Presentation / Conversation - is any of it useful here?Writing each task as a separate paragraph is a good way to organise your answer.Try to keep the information in sequence - it helps to make sure everything has been covered and makes it easier to mark!Use a suitable writing style - aletter will need a date / address / an opening and a closing statement.will not need any of these. Do not write a letter if asked for an account and vice versa.Is it clear and easy to understand with no repetition of language?Have you checked spelling and grammar structures?Are the tenses used the correct ones? You will usually need to include theHave you given an opinion / preference or point of view?Have you developed the tasks where appropriate by adding some extra information?Have you stuck to the word limit - not gone under and not gone over by too many words?Have you covered every task asked for? It is a good idea to tick each one off when completed.Be sure to treat each task equally as they all carry equal marks.You have just met a new friend in the Gaeltacht. Write a letter to your family telling them about him. Include the following information.

Tá a chuid gruaige dubh agus gairid. Tá a shúile gorm.Eoghan used a verb in the negative to describe his friend - he's not very tall- this shows very good use of language. He also correctly described his hair and eyes.Eoghan used some nice adjectives to describe his friend - lively and chatty.Tá suim mhór aige sa spórt - is breá leis iománaíocht agus imríonn sé peil Ghaelach fosta.Eoghan uses some excellent phrases to talk about his friend's interests - very interested in sport. He also used the present tense to give a bit more information - saying that his friend plays Gaelic football. This is a very good idea.D'imir muid cispheil leis na buachaillí eile inné. Chuaigh muid chuig ceolchoirm sa choláiste Dé hAoine - bhí an chraic go hiontach!Eoin used the past tense correctly to talk about things they had done. He also used ""muid"" - ""we"" because he is talking about what they did - this is important.Feicfidh mé Seán arís mar tá sé ina chónaí i nDoire fosta. Rachaidh muid go dtí an Club Óige am éigin.Eoin used the future tense correctly to say he will see his friend again because he also lives in Derry. Any reason would be fine here. Eoin also gave more information about something they will do - this is a great way to finish off.Eoghan ended his letter with an appropriate phrase -/ Bye for now. There are many different ways of signing off eg.Le grá / Slán go fóill / Slán / Ádh mór- all of these add a bit of style to your writing.This is an excellent piece of writing at this level.Sentences are accurate and easy to understand.The language used and style of writing is appropriate.It has answered the question in full and covered all five tasks asked for.There is evidence of development of tasks - extra information added when appropriate.It has only gone slightly over the word limit.The correct tenses are used and a good range of vocabulary included."
4	Infrared radiation and microwaves can be used to cook food. Microwaves are also used to transmit information - for example, in mobile phone networks.Visible light is just one type of. There are many other types of electromagnetic radiation with both longer and shorter wavelengths than visible light.The main types of electromagnetic radiation and their typical useAll objects give out and take in thermal radiation, which is also called. The hotter an object is, the more infrared radiation it emits.Very hot objects may glow, such as the heating element in a toaster or electric fire. Other hot objects may not glow, such as an iron.Some surfaces are better than others at absorbing and reflecting infrared radiation:When an object absorbs infrared radiation, its temperature increases. Food, for instance, begins to cook when its surface absorbs infrared radiation.Microwaves cannot be seen, but they can cause burns if they are absorbed by body tissues. Microwave ovens rely on the ability of microwaves to penetrate about 1cm into food. They are absorbed by water in the food, causing it to warm up.Microwaves go through plastics and glass, but are reflected by metals. To protect us from the harmful effects of microwaves, microwave ovens have metal cases, and the glass doors have a metal mesh.There is a British Standard which sets a safe limit of 50 watts per square metre at 5cm. This means that measurements of microwave power taken at 5cm from the microwave must be less than 50 watts per square metre.Mobile phones communicate with their base stations using low-intensity microwave radiation. Microwaves can be used to transmit information over large distances, although some areas have poor signals. The use of mobile phones means people are exposed to microwave radiation in two ways:to the head from the aerial in the phoneto the body from transmitters in base station mastsThere are limits to the amount of microwave radiation that can be emitted by mobile phones. This Specific Absorption Rate - SAR - should not be more than 2 watts per kilogram.Microwaves from the phone can penetrate body tissues to a depth of a few centimetres. They are absorbed, and give up their energy to body tissues. This can cause a small amount of heating, about 0.1°C - much less than if you were standing in sunshine.There is no conclusive evidence that mobile phones and masts can damage your health. But because millions of people use mobiles, many local authorities believe it is sensible to advise the public to take precautions, just in case.from 2007 about campaigners winning a two-year battle to get a mobile phone mast moved away from a primary school.You should be able to explain how infrared radiation and microwaves transfer energy to materials such as food.of particles is increased when the radiation is absorbed:infrared radiation is absorbed by all particles on the surfacemicrowave radiation is absorbed by water particles, both on the surface and up to about 1cm deep into the foodThe kinetic energy is transferred to the centre of the food by conduction or convection.The higher the frequency of an electromagnetic wave, the greater the energy it transfers for a given amplitude. Infrared radiation has a higher frequency than microwaves. It can transfer enough energy to break chemical bonds. Microwaves cannot.There is a limit to how far apart transmitters can be. The microwave radiation spreads out, and may be blocked by buildings and other obstacles. Transmitters are usually placed high up, in masts. Home wireless networks, for example, often work better if the wireless router is placed in the loft.

In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines.As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools.Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the wordin their names.

As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.Not good enough, say some nutrition experts who claim the new Snapple drinks have more calories and sugar in them than soft drinks have. Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert.Why is it important to read food labels carefully?Other nutritionists disagree.

These bullet points can be in Spanish but you must not have any full sentences or conjugated verbs. You can prepare the card well in advance of the exam so make sure you check vocabulary, gender and pronunciation thoroughly. If in doubt ask your teacher.This is how Sean's prompt card might look in Spanish:Introducción: el cine y la música, nacer Nueva York, su familia de Puerto RicoPasado: un concurso de baile, trabajar como bailadora en la tele, con Janet Jackson en un video, Out of Sight, If you had my love, unos años con Puff, muchos problemasActualmente: famosa en el el mundo del pop y del cine, mucho dinero por sus películas, trabajar más en la música que el cineEn el futuro: tener muchos maridos, trabajar más en la música que en el cine, rodear con Antonio BanderasOpinión: la música, su manera de bailar, muy ambiciosa y un poco antipática, una mujer muy atractivaThis is a good presentation. Sean has included lots of information and has used the past, present and future tenses effectively. He has included opinions but he has not explained his opinions.To improve he would need to explain his opinions. Remember the important word 'A mi me interesa el cine y la música y hay una estrella latina que me gusta mucho. Se llama Jennifer Lopez y nació en Nueva York en los Estados Unidos pero su familia es de Puerto Rico. Es una mujer muy guapa y me parece una persona ambiciosa.De pequeña le gustaba mucho el teatro y la música. Un día ganó un concurso de baile y empezó a trabajar como bailadora en la tele.

2	People in India are rebuilding their homes and lives after a powerful earthquake rocked a western section of their country on January 26. Indian officials say that the quake, which had a magnitude of 7.7, may have killed as many as 25,000 people.The quake, which was the strongest to hit India in 50 years, left devastation and heartache in its wake. Initially, rescue workers had little hope of finding survivors under rubble from toppled buildings. However, miraculous rescues did occur. For example, a rescue team saved a 4-year-old girl trapped under tons of concrete several days after the quake had struck.Disaster experts say that the quake caused more than $5 billion in damage. It will take years for the people affected by the disaster to recover from it.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.
2	"Is silencing parents a winning idea for kids' sports?Loud parents are a growing problem at youth sporting events. Nearly 60 percent of people think that parent behavior in youth sports is worse today than it was five years ago, according to the National Association of Youth Sports. ""Parents are trying to yell and scream to make their kids play better, and that just doesn't work,"" sports expert and former coach Gregory Dale toldDale and other sports experts are fans of an idea called ""Silent Saturdays."" Silent Saturdays are special game days during which parents aren't allowed to yell, scream, shout, or even speak. They can only clap to celebrate good plays and whisper to each other. Sports programs from California to New Jersey have instituted Silent Saturdays. Is quieting the sidelines a good call?Silence helps keep parents' behavior under control.Some sports leagues think zipping parents' lips is a great idea. The Dynamo Soccer Association in Bourbonnais, Illinois, started having Silent Saturdays last year. ""We're not trying to punish parents,"" Dynamo Soccer board member Ben Smith told""It's just a stress-free day for the kids.""At first, some parents were skeptical, or unsure, of the idea. But Smith says the quiet games were a big success. Instead of shouting, parents held encouraging signs and applauded. Everyone could hear the kids talking to each other on the field during the games. ""There was no negative criticism throughout the day,"" adds Smith. This year, the Dynamo board is considering two Silent Saturdays, and nearby soccer leagues are giving the program a try.Parents should be allowed to cheer on their kids.Silence doesn't work for everyone. For example, two grandparents in Bourbonnais were disappointed because they had traveled to cheer at their grandkids' game, but they had arrived on a Silent Saturday. Some experts think keeping family members quiet isn't the solution. ""Parents hate it,"" Jim Thompson, head of Positive Coaching Alliance, told""If you want parents to be positive, this is not the best way to do it.""Thompson says the solution is to train parents to cheer in a way that promotesor fair play. Thompson prefers ""Honor the Game Days"" to Silent Saturdays. What's the difference? ""Rather than telling parents to be quiet, at Honor the Game Days, [we tell parents] how to support their kids,"" he says.Are Silent Saturdays a winner for youth sports?

In October, six scientists squeezed into a small underwater laboratory to study a coral reef. They worked and slept in the tiny space for ten days. They, too, found that sharing space isn't easy.""I've been on missions where people snored,"" said Celia Smith, who led the mission in October.

They can see colorful fish swimming in the nearby reef. Smith said it's hard to tell, though, whether the aquanauts are watching the fish or the fish are watching the aquanauts.The aquanauts spend as much time as they can on the reef studying sea life. They can spend up to nine hours at one time outside the laboratory.Smith likes to remind people that humans have barely begun to explore the oceans and need to learn more about life in the deep. ""The really important thing for us to realize is how much we don't know about the oceans,"" she said.Coral reefs have been called the rain forests of the oceans. Just as many of the world's land plants and animals live in rain forests, many sea creatures live in coral reefs.Coral reefs are in danger. One-fourth of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed, and the remaining reefs could be destroyed within the next century, scientists say.Overfishing, pollution, and global warming are destroying many coral reefs, scientists explain. For example, global warming has gradually warmed the shallow ocean waters where coral reefs usually form. The warmer water has killed many, the tiny plants that give coral reefs their color and provide nourishment to the animals that form reefs.Scientist Valerie Paul worries that all the world's coral reefs will be destroyed early this century.

4	"The final part of your oral exam will take the form of a conversation with your examiner. The conversation will cover different topics, such as holidays, home and family, school and work. The number of topics that must be covered varies from syllabus to syllabus. Check with your teacher what the format of your exam will be.What you must be able to doAt foundation tier, the most important thing is to answer all the examiner's questions clearly, so that a Spanish-speaking person would understand. Of course, you should try to be as accurate as possible, but small mistakes will not always lose marks. The best foundation tier candidates will be able to refer to the past, present and future. They will also be able to express personal opinions.To do well at higher tier, you will need to be accurate and fluent. You will have to produce longer sequences of speech and use a variety of structures, tenses and vocabulary. You will also be expected to express ideas and justify your point of view.Ask your teacher to show you the standard of work required at different levels. He/she should be able to demonstrate the differences between performance at grades E, C and A.Most of your preparation will have added value, as it is likely to be useful in your writing exam as well.Prepare as much material in advance as you can. Take one topic at a time. Your teacher will probably give you some possible questions for each topic.As well as preparing answers to questions, practise giving a continuous speech on each topic.Start simple. Later on you will find opportunities to improve your work by adding a few more interesting details. Remember - it is easy to improve a simple piece of work. It is much harder to simplify something that is too complicated!The language you prepare must be your language at your level.Do not prepare notes with words or phrases that are too difficult or complicated. If you do, you will not manage a confident, lively conversation and you will get a low mark.Sometimes you may hesitate in the conversation. Try to do this in Spanish. Don't say 'um...' or 'er...'. Instead, prepare some useful Spanish 'fillers' such as 'The better prepared you are, the easier it will be to seem relaxed, fluent and spontaneous in the exam.Look at the examiner. Eye contact is very important. It will help the examiner to help you.Avoid making the conversation sound like a rehearsed set of questions with easy answers. One way to do this is to think of each question as a ""trigger"" to help you say as much good Spanish as you can. For example, if your examiner asks you to talk about your family, don't just name the members of your family and wait for the next question. Instead, develop your reply by taking one member of the family and describing their personality, as well as their physical appearance. You could then give your opinion of that person and say whether you get on well together, and why.Don't panic if the examiner asks you a question you have not prepared. Short answers, as well as complete sentences are both acceptable. Try to be spontaneous and to respond quickly and confidently.If you don't understand a question, ask the examiner (in Spanish) to repeat it '' . If you still don't understand, say so '' and let the examiner move on. Avoid long silences.Don't worry if things get harder as the conversation develops. Remember, it's the examiner's job to 'push' you as far as you can go. If everything was too easy, the examiner would be letting you under-achieve."

On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that having separate schools for black students and white students violated the U.S. Constitution.In 1951, Linda Brown, a third-grade student in Topeka, Kansas, was one of many African American children forced to attend black-only schools. Even though the school for white students was just blocks from her house, Linda had to travel all the way across town to an all-black school., or separate, public schools were legal at the time--as long as the black and white students had an ""equal"" education. That idea was known as ""separate but equal.""However, the reality was that segregation was unequal. Schools for black students were generally run-down and overcrowded and lacked supplies. In comparison, schools for white students were newer and had smaller class sizes and better supplies.When Linda was denied entrance to the all-white school, her father and 12 other parents sued the Topeka school system. The case was eventually heard by the Supreme Court. The Court ruled that ""separate educational facilities are... unequal.""As a child, Linda Brown was part of theof America's public schools.

They are not from any exam papers.the ground, seas and clouds in a range of different wavelengths. The images they produce give useful information about the Earth. One such satellite is the TERRA satellite, operated by the USA, Canada and Japan.The satellite orbits just 700km above the ground, and takes about two hours to complete each orbit of 45 000km. That’s more than ten times faster than the fastest commercial airliner on Earth.There are several cameras on board to record the Earth. One of these cameras records radiation in three different parts of the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, shown as blue bands in the diagram:The information from the different ranges of wavelength recorded by the cameras are transmitted to Earth as digital signals, using. The microwave beam spreads out a little when it leaves the satellite aerial just as all waves do when they go through a gap, but the digital signal reaching the Earth still contains all the information. The signals for different wavelengths are combined together to give the beautiful images that we are used to seeing from satellites. The colours in these images are not true colours, as the wavelengths being combined are not the ones to which our eyes are sensitive, but they show all the detail needed to look at the use of land, the effect of global warming on sea levels and temperatures, the amount of cloud cover and its effect on weather.Calculate the speed in km/hour of the satellite in its orbit.The diagram shows three regions of the electromagnetic spectrum: ultraviolet, visible light and infrared. Which of these three regions has photons of the greatest energy?Which of these three regions of the electromagnetic spectrum has the highest frequency?One other region of the electromagnetic spectrum, apart from ultraviolet, visible light and infrared, is named in the article.The diagram below shows a fuller view of the electromagnetic spectrum. The blue bands show the three regions of the spectrum recorded by the camera in the satellite.Label the region you have named in question 4.The article describes waves spreading out when they go through a gap.What is the name for this spreading?Satellite images produced by this camera make good use of colour, including blue and violet. Explain how you can tell, from the diagrams of the spectrum, that these colours were not present in the original image.Read this aditional information and answer the questions below.Visible light recorded by the satellite cameras is sunlight that has been reflected by the land, sea or clouds. Long wavelength infrared is given off by warm objects.This version of the spectrum in the article has two of the wavelength bands recorded by the camera labelled A and B.Explain how the amount of regions A and B recorded by the camera for the same part of the Earth would change over 24 hours.Explain how the amount of regions A and B recorded by the camera would compare, on the same day in March, between an African country and a snowy northern country such as Canada.The fastest commercial aircraft (no longer flying) was the Concorde, which went at 2180 km/hour. Show that the satellite is moving more than ten times as fast as this, as the article states.Thoroughly check your answers as marks will be awarded for correct spelling, punctuation and grammar.Speed = 45,000 km / 2 hours = 22,500 km/hourThe blue blocks showing the wavelengths recorded by the cameras do not go to the smallest-wavelength end of the visible spectrum. This is the end where blue and violet light are found, so the cameras do not record blue and violet.would go down at lot at night, as it got dark, because there would be no visible light to reflect.would go down as the Earth got cooler, but not nearly so much.would be greater for the snowy northern country, as snow will reflect more light than land.would be greater for the African country, as it is warmer than a snowy northern one.The speed of Concorde was 2180 km/hour, and ten times this is 21,800 km/hour. This is less than the satellite speed calculated in question 1 (22,500 km/hour).

But there are limits to the testing, and the subject raises a number of ethical issues.The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.that cause genetic disorders. It can be done at any stage in a person’s life. There are several types of genetic test, including testing for medical research.This is used to analyse an individual’s DNA orOne of the rod shaped bodies found in the nucleus of cells that contain genetic information (DNA).before they are born. At the moment, it cannot detect all inherited disorders. Prenatal testing is offered to couples who may have an increased risk of producing a baby with an inherited disorder. Prenatal testing for Down’s syndrome, which is caused by a faulty chromosome, is offered to all pregnant women.Neonatal testing involves analysing a sample of blood taken by pricking the babyâs heelThis is used just after a baby has been born. It is designed to detect genetic disorders that can be treated early. In the UK, all babies are screened for phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism and cystic fibrosis. Babies born to families that are at risk of sickle cell disease are tested for this disorder.This is used to identify people who carry adescribes the variant of a gene for a particular characteristic which is masked or suppressed in the presence of the dominant variant. A recessive gene will remain dormant unless it is paired with another recessive geneallele, such as the allele for cystic fibrosis. It is offered to individuals who have a family history of a genetic disorder. Carrier testing is particularly useful if both parents are tested, because if both are carriers there is an increased risk of producing a baby with a genetic disorder.This is used to detect genetic disorders where the symptoms develop later in life, such as Huntington’s disorder. Predictive testing can be valuable to people who have no symptoms but have a family member with a genetic disorder. The results can help to inform decisions about possible medical care.Genetic tests are not available for every possible inherited disorder. And they are not completely reliable. They may produce false positive, or false negative, results. These can have serious consequences.A false positive occurs when a genetic test has wrongly detected a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family could believe something is wrong when it is not. This may lead them to decide not to start a family, or to choose an abortion, in order to avoid having a baby with a genetic disorder.A false negative happens when a genetic test has failed to detect a certain allele or faulty chromosome. The individual or family would be wrongly reassured. This may lead them to decide to start a family or continue with a pregnancy.Fed up of reading?

They're trying to determine whether a skull kept at a private location in Salzburg, Austria, belongs to the famous music composer. Austria is a country in Europe.Mozart was born in Salzburg in 1756 and was buried in Vienna, Austria, in 1791. According to legend, sometime later a gravedigger took the skull, which eventually ended up in Salzburg.Now scientists have opened a grave in Salzburg that they believe holds the remains of Mozart's father and other relatives. Researchers plan to conduct DNA tests on those remains.DNA from humans contains information that scientists can use to determine whether people are related to each other. The skull could belong to Mozart if it matches the DNA of his father or other relatives.Austria has officially declared 2006 the year of celebrations for Mozart. That country will, or honor, the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.
4	Earthquakes produce shock waves that cause damage. There are two types of seismic wave - p-waves and s-waves. Seismometers can detect these waves and provide evidence of the Earth’s structure.The ozone layer reduces the amount of ultraviolet light from the Sun that reaches the Earth’s surface. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation can lead to sunburn and skin cancer, but sunblocks can reduce this damage.Increased energy use and deforestation raise the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This leads to global warming.The Earth’s crust and upper mantle are broken up into huge. Where these meet, the Earth’s crust becomes unstable and earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur.Earthquakes cause damage to buildings, and often lead to loss of life. It is difficult to predict exactly when an earthquake might happen and how bad it will be, even in places that are known for having earthquakes.Earthquakes produce shock waves. These travel through the Earth and can be detected using a device called aThere are two types of seismic wave.P-waves are longitudinal waves like sound waves, and s-waves are transverse waves like light wavesUltraviolet radiation is found naturally in sunlight. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation can cause:We cannot see or feel ultraviolet radiation, but our skin responds to it by turning darker. This happens in an attempt to reduce the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches deeper skin tissues.Darker skins absorb more ultraviolet light, so less ultraviolet radiation reaches the deeper tissues. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can cause normal cells to become cancerous.Sunblocks can reduce the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation. They contain chemicals that absorb a lot of the radiation and prevent it from reaching our skin. They may also contain chemicals that reflect some of the radiation away from the skin.Manufacturers of sunblocks make products with different sun protectionthe higher the factor, the longer you can stay out in the sun without burninghigh factor sunblocks reduce the risks from ultraviolet radiation more than low factor sunblocksIf, for example, you would get sunburnt after ten minutes in the sun, with Factor 5 applied you could stay in the sun for 50 minutes - or for 1500 minutes with Factor 150 applied. But the real time is usually lower, because some of the sunblock gets absorbed by the skin, and some gets rubbed off.Dust from volcanoes reflects heat radiation from the Sun, leading to cooling. But dust from factories reflects heat radiation from cities, stopping it from escaping. This leads to warming in urban areas.. It absorbs heat energy that is radiated from the Earth’s surface and prevents it from escaping into space. This keeps the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be. But human activities are increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This increases theCarbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen at a higher rate since the 19th centuryThe temperature of the earth has risen over the yearsHuman activities leading to global warming include:Most of the energy we use comes from burning fossil fuels. These release carbon dioxide when they burn. So the increasing use of energy is leading to increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.When land is cleared for timber and farms, there are fewer trees to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Also, if the fallen trees are burned or left to rot, additional carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere.A knowledge of how seismic waves travel through the Earth provides us with evidence of the Earth’s structure. Remember that:p-waves travel through solids and liquids, so they can travel through all of the Earth’s layerss-waves cannot travel through liquid rock, so they cannot travel through the outer coreThe speed of p-waves and s-waves increases as they travel deeper into the mantle. They travel through the Earth in curved paths, but they change direction suddenly when they pass through the boundary between substances in different states. The diagrams show what happens when p-waves and s-waves pass through the Earth:S-waves cannot pass through the liquid outer core, but p-waves can. When p-waves pass from solid to liquid, then from liquid to solid, there are sudden changes in direction.is the part of the upper atmosphere where ozone is found in the highest concentrations. The ozone there absorbs ultraviolet radiation, preventing most of it from reaching the ground. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can lead to skin cancer., are chemicals that were once used widely in insulating foam and aerosol spray-cans. They release reactive chlorine atoms in the upper atmosphere. These break down ozone and damage the ozone layer. CFCs have now been almost completely replaced by chemicals that do not destroy ozone.
3	There are many ways to start off an improvisation. One way is to take a prop and imagine what it could be. Think of some ways to improvise a use for these everyday items and check your ideas against ours.An empty kitchen roll could be: a trumpet, a phial containing a precious potion, a wand, a telescope, a scroll containing a deadly secret.A paper plate could be: a steering wheel, a shield, a window into another world, a helmet that allows you to read people's thoughts, a miniature flying saucer.A plactic cup could be: a gas mask, an ants' nest, a cup containing a liquid that turns you into a monster with just one sip, the home of a very small but very poisonous snakeOnce you've come up with an idea, you can create a story together.The best improvisations happen through teamwork. One person's idea will grow if other people add imaginative ideas.If one actor takes over, the others are left not knowing what to do. It's important to make sure that you give everyone an equal chance to play. And, if they're struggling, help them subtly.Don't be such a drama queen!

4	Animals and plants have features that allow them to adapt to their environment. The organisms in a community compete with each other for limited resources, including water and space. Plants also compete with each other for light and minerals.Several words are used to describe organisms in their environment.The meaning of some common words used to describe organismsall the conditions that surround a living organismall the members of a single species that live in a habitatall the populations of different organisms that live together in a habitatFor example, a pond ecosystem consists of a pond habitat, inhabited by aquatic plants, waterside plants, micro-organisms, minnows and herons. The organisms together make up a community of living things.Every organism has certain features or characteristics that allow it to live successfully in itsA place where plants, animals and micro-organisms live.. These features are called adaptations, and we say that the organism is adapted to its habitat. Organisms living in different habitats needPolar bears are well adapted for survival in the Arctic. They have:as camouflage from prey on the snow and icea small surface area to volume ratioto distribute their load and increase grip on the iceThe polar bear is adapted to life in a cold climateThe snowshoe hare has white fur in the winter and reddish-brown fur in the summer. This means that it is camouflaged from its predators for most of the year.The Arctic is cold and windy with very little rainfall. Plants in the Arctic often grow very close to the ground and have small leaves. This helps to conserve water and to avoid damage by the wind.The camel is adapted to life in a hot climateCamels live in deserts that are hot and dry during the day, but cold at night. They are well adapted for survival in the desert.to spread their weight on the sandon the top of the body for shade, and thin fur elsewhere to allow easy heat lossa large surface area to volume ratioability to go for a long time without water- they don't store water in their humps, but they lose very little through urination and sweatingslit-like nostrils and two rows of eyelashesA cactus is adapted to life in a hot climateCacti are well adapted for survival in the desert. They have:widespread root systems that can collect water from a large area. These minimise the surface area and so reduce water loss bythe loss of water from leaves by evaporation. It is much faster when stomata are open than when they are closed. The spines also protect the cacti from animals that might eat them.Animals and plants may have specific features that adapt them to their environment. These include barbs and spines, poisons and warning colours that deter predators and herbivores. Some harmless species may even resemble a poisonous or dangerous species to increase their chances of survival.Habitats have limited amounts of the resources needed by living organisms. Organisms can only survive if they can get enough resources. They must compete with other organisms for these resources. If they are unsuccessful and cannot move to another habitat, they will die.Some of the resources that animals compete for:Animals may also compete for mates so that they can reproduce.Remember that plants make their own food usingphotosynthesis is the process where green plants use water and carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce carbohydrates (stored energy) and release oxygen (as a by-product)., so they do not compete for food. Some of the things that plants do compete for are:from 2006 about the problems caused to natural habitats when water companies remove a lot of water for our use.Human beings are very successful organisms. We compete with animals and plants all over the world. For example, our farmers compete with animals and plants for water and space, and with animals for food.
2	History in the Making: Mercury 3 Rescue MissionThe Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.What was the purpose of this mission?NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.In the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida.How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.

2	It's hatching time. About every three years, female rattlesnakes lay eggs. Those eggs hatch between August and October, when the baby snakes break through their soft shells and start to slither around.Baby rattlesnakes don't have rattles until weeks after they hatch. The rattles form over time as the snakes repeatedly shed their skin.A baby rattlesnake sheds its skin for the first time about two weeks after it hatches. A rattlesnake shakes its rattle to warn other animals that it is nearby.Many baby rattlesnakes don't live to become adults. Because of the babies' small size, other animalson them, or eat them. Raccoons, hawks, and many other animals eat baby rattlesnakes.

4	Acids and alkalis are some of the most widely used chemicals both in industry and our homes., and must be handled with care. But other acids are common chemicals that we use every day.is found in fruits such as oranges and lemons. These acids are safe to eat.It is a similar story with alkalis. A concentrated solution of the alkali. It can be used to remove skin from bones to obtain skeletons. Butis such a mild alkali it can be taken as an indigestion remedy.Acids and alkalis that are dangerous are stored in containers which have hazard warning signs to show they are corrosive. These chemicals need to be handled with care, with goggles and gloves worn.The table lists some common acids and alkalis:gas, dissolves in water to make hydrochloric acidIt is possible to tell if a solution is. An indicator is a substance which has different colours when it is in acidic or alkaline conditions. Litmus is probably the most well-known indicator. This is. Litmus can be used as a liquid, or as litmus paper.Solutions of acids and alkalis can vary widely in their acidity and alkalinity. It is useful to know not just whether a solution is an acid or an alkali, butacidic or how alkaline it is. To measure acidity and alkalinity, we can use theThe easiest way to do this is to use Universal indicator. This is a mixture of several different indicators, and can be used as a liquid or paper. It has many different colour changes.The colour of the Universal indicator shows the pH value of the solution. The pH scale runs fromDiagram of pH scale and universal indicator coloursTo get a more accurate measurement of the pH of a solution, we can use a pH meter. This device can measure the pH of a solution to 0.01 of a pH unit.with metals, metal oxides, metal hydroxides and metal carbonates. During each of these reactions a salt is made.Acids will react with reactive metals, such as magnesium and zinc, to make a salt and hydrogen.acid + metal → salt + hydrogenmagnesium + sulfuric acid → magnesium sulfate + hydrogenThe hydrogen causes bubbling during the reaction. It can be detected using a, which causes the gas to burn with a squeaky pop.Acids react with metal oxides and hydroxides to produce a salt and water.acid + metal oxide → salt + wateracid + metal hydroxide → salt + waterhydrochloric acid + copper(II) oxide → copper(II) chloride + waternitric acid + calcium hydroxide → calcium nitrate + waterWhen acids react with carbonates, a salt, water and carbon dioxide are made.acid + carbonate → salt + water + carbon dioxidesodium carbonate + hydrochloric acid → sodium chloride + carbon dioxide + waterThe carbon dioxide causes bubbling during the reaction. It can be detected using, which turns a milky white when carbon dioxide is bubbled through it.When an acid reacts with a metal, metal oxide, metal hydroxide or metal carbonate, a salt is made. The name of the salt can be easily worked out.part of the name comes from the metal, or the metal in the oxide, hydroxide or carbonate.part of the name comes from the acid used:The table shows some acids, the compounds they have reacted with, and the salts produced.Examples of salts produced by some acids and compoundsName and formula of metal, oxide, hydroxide or carbonateRead on if you are taking theWhen an acidic compound dissolves in water it produces hydrogen ions, H. These ions are responsible for theWhen an alkaline compound dissolves in water it produces hydroxide ions, OH. These ions are responsible for theAcids react with alkalis to form salts. These are called. In each reaction, water is also formed:acid + alkali → salt + waterhydrochloric acid + sodium hydroxide → sodium chloride + waterHCl + NaOH → NaCl + HHydrochloric acid contains hydrogen ions and chloride ions dissolved in water.Sodium hydroxide solution contains sodium ions and hydroxide ions dissolved in water.The salt sodium chloride is formed when the acid and alkali are mixed together. This salt is produced as sodium ions and chloride ions in solution. There is no change to the sodium ions and chloride ions during the reaction to make sodium chloride. They were dissolved in water in the acid and in the alkali, and they are still dissolved in water as the salt.The only change that does produce something different during the neutralisation is the reaction between hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which produces water molecules.This is the ionic equation that represents the neutralisation reaction between any acid and any alkali.The name of the salt produced in the neutralisation depends on which acid reacts with which alkali. But the ionic equation for the neutralisation is always the same.

4	"With the election of 1936 looming andstill a major problem Roosevelt introduced morein the second New Deal. He wanted to further reform America and improve people's lives.Although Roosevelt restored hope and staved off the collapse of the banking system, the problem of unemployment was more difficult and at the start of 1934 there was still 11.3 million people out of work. Some historians have said that failing to deal with unemployment was the biggest weakness of the New Deal. Criticism of Roosevelt emerged from several directions.With this criticism in mind and the 1936 presidential election on the horizon, the New Deal began to change direction. Some historians have interpreted the change by saying there were two New Deals - the first dealing with the immediate emergency of 1933-34 and the second, which emerged in 1935-1936, offering more radical, reforming policies:- this agency employed people to build schools, hospitals and other public buildings.- this agency aimed to bring electricity to America's farms.(Wagner Act) - this act aimed to improve relations between workers and employers, especially as 1934 had seen a series of violent industrial disputes.Some historians say that, where the first New Deal aimed to save America and its capitalist economic system, the second New Deal aimed to change America.The wealthy businessmen behind the American Liberty League argued that by increasing taxation and encouraging the development of the trade union movement, Roosevelt hadhis own class (Roosevelt was from a very wealthy family).began writing letters saying things like this one from a man in California -""you are multi-millionaires, what do you care for the masses of the people?""- the Governor of Louisiana, known as The Kingfish, launched the Share our Wealth campaign in which personal fortunes of more than $3 million would be redistributed to ordinary citizens.- a Canadian priest - broadcast popular sermons on the CBS network, promising to nationalise the banks.planned to boost the economy by raising pensions for the over 60s - in return, they would spend $200 a month to increase demand for consumer goods.Cartoon titled 'The Illegal Act' - caption reads: 'I'm sorry, but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again'Does Source A criticise or support the New Deal?At first glance, the cartoon could be mistaken for criticising Roosevelt and the New Deal. It looks like Roosevelt is rescuing another person from the sea of Depression and pulling him into his National Recovery boat. Many New Deal critics were opposed to the cost of the New Deal to the American taxpayer.However, the cartoon is actually criticising the US Supreme Court - the caption gives it away - Roosevelt is saying: ""I'm sorry but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again"", and he is shown to be pushing the man's head down. This is because the Supreme Court did not agree with many of Roosevelt's New Deal proposals and, therefore, did not pass them.This cartoon sympathises with Roosevelt as it shows him unwillingly pushing away the man who needs saving.If you are given an image source to study in your exam, make sure that you read the captions and look at the details very closely. As demonstrated with Source A, it is very easy to misinterpret a source at initial glance.Make another spider diagram starting with President Roosevelt at the centre.

Steel is widely used as a structural material, for example to make bridges, buildings, ships and cars.from 2006 about how the price of copper has risen so high on world markets that some copper coins are now worth more than their face value.Copper is a very good conductor of electricity, so it is used for electricity cables. It is easily bent into shape and it does not react with water, so it is used for water pipes.Silver does not corrode in air or water, and it is a very good conductor of electricity. It is used for jewellery, printed circuit boards and electrical contacts.Gold does not corrode in air or water, and it is a good conductor of electricity. It is used for jewellery, connecting wires for computer chips and electrical contacts.
2	Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, homeland security has become an important issue for many people.This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe.President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005.Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment.Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security.Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it.

2	"HI! MY NAME IS PAM POLLSTER. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.. The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. Ais a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.. A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.. Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.It's As Easy As One, Two, ThreeSo how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.. The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you preferPolling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!. The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.. We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

This was a society in which people were wealthy enough to pay to take care of their health., which required temples, priests and rituals that included mummification. Their experience of mummification taught the priests about the workings of the human body, and some members of the priesthood evolved into professional doctors.Further still, the Egyptians invented the skills of, which Egyptian doctors were able to use to develop their ideas and record their cures.The ancient Egyptians travelled and traded all over the known world, and brought back all kinds of herbs and spices, which their doctors then used to heal certain diseases.

Elementary-school children at the Clark County School District in Las Vegas recently said good-bye to recess.Why has this Las Vegas district and many others eliminated, or, recess? School officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on their standardized tests.The students in Clark County have a 30-minute lunch period. They have to squeeze playground minutes into that half-hour block. They no longer get an additional 15- to 20-minute recess.Many teachers, parents, and students disagree with the decision to ban recess. Education experts often say that recess is an important part of the school day.Those experts say that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends. At recess, many students learn how to cooperate and play with other students.

4	Forensic scientists analyse substances from a crime scene using many methods - including checking for traces of metals that might indicate a link between significant people or objects in the case.Individual transition metals can be identified by the colour of their precipitate with sodium hydroxide solution. Flame tests can be used to identify a particular metal.Transition metals form coloured compounds with other elements. Many of these are soluble in water, forming coloured solutions. If sodium hydroxide solution is then added, a transition metal hydroxide is formed. These are insoluble. They do not dissolve but instead form solid precipitates. Here are the equations for copper sulphate solution reacting with sodium hydroxide solution:copper sulphate + sodium hydroxide    →    copper hydroxide + sodium sulphate    +     2NaOH        →        Cu(OH)(blue solution + colourless solution → blue precipitate + colourless solution)Copper solutions form a blue precipitate with sodium hydroxideDifferent transition metals form different coloured precipitates.Some common transition metals and the colours of their precipitates.green - turns orange-brown when left standingHow could you tell if an unknown substance contained iron(II) nitrate or iron(III) nitrate? You would add a few drops of sodium hydroxide solution. If you got a dark green precipitate it would show that the unknown substance was iron(II) nitrate; if you got an orange-brown precipitate it would show that the unknown substance was iron(III) nitrate.Note that it is the metal that determines the colour. So you would get the same result whether you used zinc chloride or zinc nitrate - a white precipitate in this example.Understand the elements and their properties, try this activity!The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

Nitrogen monoxide then reacts with more oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide.is a poisonous gas. It dissolves in rain water to form acid rain and contributes to the formation of smog. In city streets it can build up to concentrations that may be harmful to the lungs.But recent studies suggest that the danger from nitrogen dioxide could also be in our homes. The World Health Organisation recommends an hourly limit of 200 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide in each cubic metre of air. In a survey scientists found that many homes that use gas for cooking sometimes have concentrations above this limit.The table shows a comparison between nitrogen dioxide concentrations in samples of air from one kitchen when a gas cooker was in use, and from a city street.Nitrogen dioxide in samples of air (µg/mOne scientist said, ""I am not sure whether the nitrogen dioxide concentration in my own kitchen is dangerous, but I am going to fit an extractor fan to take the air out of my kitchen while we are cooking.""Describe two harmful effects of nitrogen dioxide.In a car engine nitrogen and oxygen combine.

4	Sound waves are longitudinal waves that must pass through a medium. Ultrasound waves have a frequency above the normal range of human hearing. They can be used to scan for birth defects in unborn babies and for defects in manufactured equipment. They can also be used to clean delicate equipment without the need to take it apart.Seismic waves travel through the Earth. There are two types - P waves and S waves. They have different properties and they can give scientists information about the Earth's structure.Sound waves are longitudinal waves. Their vibrations occur in the same direction as the direction of travel. Sound waves can only travel through a solid, liquid or gas.When an object or substance vibrates, it produces sound. The bigger the vibrations, the greater theThe maximum height of a wave, measured from the mid-point of its vibration.These diagrams show snapshots from oscilloscope traces of three sounds.Diagrams 1 and 2 show two sounds with the same frequency but different amplitude (the height of the trace). The trace oncomes from a sound with a smaller amplitude than on. Sound 1 is quieter than sound 2.Diagrams 2 and 3 show two sounds with the same amplitude but different frequencies. The faster the vibrations, the higher theThe number of repetitions per second of a wave. The unit of frequency is the hertz, 'Hz'.and the more highly pitched the sound.comes from a sound with a higher frequency than the one on. So sounds 2 and 3 are the same volume (loudness), but 3 is higher pitched.The normal range of human hearing is between about 20Hz and 20kHz, but the range becomes less as we get older. Sounds with frequencies above about 20kHz are called ultrasound.As we saw on the previous page, ultrasound waves have frequencies above about 20kHz (20,000Hz). This is above the normal hearing range for humans, so we cannot hear ultrasound.When ultrasound waves reach a boundary between two substances with different densities, they are partly reflected back. The remainder of the ultrasound waves continue to pass through. A detector placed near the source of the ultrasound waves is able to detect the reflected waves. It can measure the time between an ultrasound wave leaving the source and reaching the detector. The further away the boundary, the longer the time between leaving the source and reaching the detector:distance (metre, m) = speed (metre/second, m/s) × time (second, s)For example, sound travels through water at about 1,400 m/s. If it takes 0.5 s for a sound to reach a boundary and reflect back to the detector, the total distance travelled is:The distance to the boundary is half this, which is 350 m.The distances and times are much smaller of course when scanning babies and in engineering jobs.3-D ultrasound scan of a human foetusComputers are able to create detailed images by combining many ultrasound reflection readings. This is used in medicine for pre-natal scanning - checking unborn babies.Ultrasound can be used in industry for quality control procedures to check manufactured objects, such as railway tracks and oil pipelines, for damage or defects.

They travel through the Earth in curved paths, but they change direction suddenly when they pass through the boundary between substances in different states. The diagrams show what happens when P waves and S waves pass through the Earth.S waves cannot pass through the liquid outer core, but P waves can. When P waves pass from solid to liquid, then from liquid to solid, there are sudden changes in direction.

Students Damian Johnson, Keith Bennett, and Tashay Moody agree that it's important for kids to volunteer.As 16-year-old Damian Johnson puts it: ""[Volunteering] makes me feel like I have made an impact on people who don't have as much as I have.""""How can I make a difference in the world if I'm just an ordinary kid?"" Thirteen-year-old author Sondra Clark answers that question in her fourth book,!, which hit bookstores in March. She shows kids that small actions, such as donating videos to a children's hospital, can make a big difference.Clark was motivated to write her book after reading an article on volunteerism in. She has traveled to Africa to help children. Currently, she is traveling across the United States with her parents to share her experiences.The action doesn't stop for actor Sean Astin when the cameras stop rolling. Astin, one of the stars of The Lord of the Rings movies and the father of two young children, is inspiring kids to make the world a better place.In January, Astin was appointed to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. President George W. Bush created the council to encourage volunteerism. He has urged Americans to make a lifetime commitment to volunteering.Astin tells kids that it's easy to make a difference. As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, he volunteered his time helping preschool students cross the street. He told Weekly Reader, ""I remember feeling that because I was helping someone, I had an incredible responsibility, and it felt great.

Not only are they all celebrities, but they are also allThose celebrities are part of the rapidly growing Hispanic American population in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanic Americans now make up the largest minority group in the country. AHispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Those parts of the world include Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and most countries in Central America and South America. In the United States, many Hispanic Americans are also called Latinos.As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our country’s history.Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, toldthat to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, includingBaseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides, are popular with many young readers.In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASA’s training program.

2	"Are Kids' Movies and TV Shows Too Violent?have in common? Both movies were made for kids and are rated G, which means they are OK for everyone to watch. But two scientists say those movies and many others should be rated ""V"" for their violent content.The two scientists--Kimberly Thompson and Fumie Yokota--work for Harvard University. They watched 74 G-rated movies and said, ""We were surprised that every single movie had some act of violence."" The violence in the movies ranged from insults to attacks.One in five TV shows for kids has no educational content, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center.The two scientists also found that, in 46 of the movies, at least one character was hurt. And they found that, in 37 of the movies, at least one character was killed.Most of the movies contained nearly ten minutes of violence, the scientists said. The most violent movie the scientists watched was. That movie has 24 minutes of violence, Thompson and Yokota said.Violent programs can also be found on TV. The Media in the Home Survey, conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, recently found that more than one-quarter of all children's TV shows had four or more violent scenes in each episode.Some scientists say that watching too many violent TV shows and movies could make some kids violent. Watching violent shows could make some kids ""think it's no big deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,"" said Yokota.Scientists also worry that kids might imitate the violent acts they see on TV and in movies. Joanne Cantor, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said TV and movies usually don't show the effects of violence. Instead, shows often make violence look funny. Kids who think violence is funny might hurt other people without thinking about the pain they're causing.You can protect yourself from violent TV shows and movies. First, you can limit the amount of TV you watch. The American Pediatrics Association says kids should watch no more than two hours of TV a day. Next, watch TV and movies with your parents. Talk with your parents about what you are watching on TV, and discuss what would happen if the same things happened in real life.You and your parents can use the Internet, magazines, and newspapers to learn more about TV shows and movies. For instance, you can read TV and movie reviews on the ""Kids-in-Mind"" and ""Screen It"" Web sites.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
2	"In October, a colorful object blazed through the sky over several states. Hundreds of people in Colorado, Utah, and Idaho saw the bright light. Many of them called local authorities to report what they saw.""We've gotten several reports of [a] brilliant white light the size of a basketball with blue flames turning to orange,"" said one police official.The people had seen an unidentified flying object, or UFO. Many people think that UFOs are spacecraft from other planets. Actually, ais anything that you see in the sky and cannot identify. Usually, even the most mysterious UFOs are eventually explained.Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery.For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
4	Human enzymes usually work best at 37ºC, which is human body temperature. This can be measured in several places, including the ear, finger, mouth and anus.There are various ways to measure body temperature, including using a clinical thermometer, heat-sensitive strips, digital probes or thermal imaging cameras.high temperatures can cause dehydration, heat stroke, and death if untreatedlow temperatures can cause hypothermia, and death if untreatedThe body’s temperature is monitored by the brain. If you are too hot or too cold, the brain sends nerve impulses to the skin, which has three ways to either increase or decrease heat loss from the body’s surface:Hairs on the skin trap more warm air if they are standing up, and less if they are lying flat. Tiny muscles in the skin can quickly pull the hairs upright to reduce heat loss, or lay them down flat to increase heat loss.If the body is too hot, glands under the skin secrete sweat onto the surface of the skin, to increase heat loss by evaporation. Sweat secretion stops when body temperature returns to normal.Blood vessels supplying blood to the skin can swell or dilate - called vasodilation. This causes more heat to be carried by the blood to the skin, where it can be lost to the air. Blood vessels can shrink down again - called vasoconstriction. This reduces heat loss through the skin once the body’s temperature has returned to normal.Muscles can also receive messages from the brain when you are cold. They respond by shivering, which warms you up.- Hair muscles pull hais on end.- Hair muscles relax. Hairs lie flat so heat can escape.- Sweat secreted by sweat glands. Cools skin by evaporation.A very common mistake in exams is to write that the blood vessels move up and down in the skin. The blood vessels do not move during vasodilation and vasoconstriction.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.This page is best viewed in an up-to-date web browser with style sheets (CSS) enabled.

The hydrogen atom is now in contact with two electrons in its highest energy level - so the hydrogen is also stable.Atoms may form multiple covalent bonds - that is, share not just one pair of electrons but two or more pairs. Atoms of different elements will form either one, two, three or four covalent bonds with other atoms.There is a quick way to work out how many covalent bonds an element will form. The number of covalent bonds is equal to eight minus the group number (you can brush up on group numbers by reading through the section in AQA GCSE Science on the). The table below gives more detail on this rule:Hydrogen forms one covalent bond.

4	Scientists believe that the universe began in a hot 'big bang' about 13,600 million years ago. The universe continues to expand. Stars do not remain the same but change as they age. The evidence for the Big Bang Theory includes the existence of a microwave background radiation, and red-shift.The universe contains extremely dense objects, called black holes, and may consist mostly of dark matter that cannot be seen.Scientists have gathered a lot of evidence and information about the universe. They have used their observations to develop a theory called the Big Bang. The theory states that about 13, 600 million years ago all the matter in the universe was concentrated into a single incredibly tiny point. This began to enlarge rapidly in a, and it is still expanding today.The Milky Way galaxy is home to planet EarthGravity is slowing down the rate of expansion. It is possible that the universe may expand for ever, or it may stop expanding. It may even contract and become very small again - the 'There are other scientific theories for the origin of the universe. For example, thesuggests that this universe is one of many - some that have existed in the past, and others that will exist in the future. When the universe contracts in a Big Crunch, a new universe is created in a new Big Bang.suggests that as the universe expands new matter is created, so that the overall appearance of the universe never changes.Sometimes the age of the universe is given as 13.6 billion years. This is because In scientific terms 1 billion is defined as a 1,000 million.You should know how stars are formed.Stars form from massive clouds of dust and gas in spaceGravity pulls the dust and gas togetherAs the mass falls together it gets hot. A star is formed when it is hot enough for ato start - the hydrogen nuclei fuse together to make helium. This releases energy which keeps the core of the star hot.During this stable phase in the life of a star, the force of gravity holding the star together is balanced by the high pressure due to the high temperatures. Our Sun is at this stable phase in its life.The Sun is halfway through its 10 billion year stable phaseYou should know that stars do not stay the same forever, and their future depends on how much mass they have.Our sun is a type of star called a. It has been shining for nearly five billion years, and has enough hydrogen fuel to last another five billion years. The sun and other stars eventually begin to run out of hydrogen. Gravity makes the core of the star smaller and hotter, which results in the outer layers expanding. They eventually expand so much that the star becomes a red giant star.6.2 billion years from now the Sun will have become a red giant starAfter a star becomes a red giant, what happens next depends on how massive the star is. If its mass is relatively small, gravity eventually leads to the star contracting to form a white dwarf. It fades and changes colour as it cools. The matter in a white dwarf is millions of times denser than the matter on Earth.A white dwarf star compared to EarthIf the red giant star has enough matter, it may collapse inwards under its own force of gravity and then explode outwards, to form a supernova.The explosion from a star forming a supernova throws dust and gas into space. This may eventually form parts of a new stars. The material left behind after the explosion forms a very dense type of star, called a neutron star (much denser than a white dwarf).Evidence for the Big Bang - higherThere are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. Theses areYou may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretationThe light from other galaxies is red-shifted.The other galaxies are moving away from us.The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.Black holes and dark matter - highermay form a neutron star. However, if enough matter is left behind, it may contract under its own gravity to become extremely dense, with such a strong gravitational field that nothing can escape from it. This includes electromagnetic radiation such as light, so it is called a black hole.Black hole - formed when a massive star collapsesBlack holes cannot be seen, but their effects on the gases from neighbouring stars can be observed. For example, X-rays are emitted when these gases spiral into a black hole.Some of the observations of the universe, such as the spinning rates of galaxies, cannot easily be explained using our current theories about gravity. Scientists have suggested that the matter we can see – stars, planets and galaxies – are only part of the mass of the universe. They have suggested that most of the mass is actually matter we cannot see, called dark matter.The existence of dark matter would allow scientists to explain their observations. However, some scientists doubt whether it really exists. They have suggested that our laws of gravity need tweaking to work properly when very large objects and distances are involved.

They are mainly found in Nepal and southern China. Habitat loss and illegal hunting have endangered red pandas in the wild.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation.
4	"The nature of the Cold War 1948-1961in the Cold War - the death of Stalin and a new Soviet leader; the growth of Communism in the Far East; the assertion of Soviet rule in Eastern Europe; the increased use of espionage between the USA and USSR; and the physical separation of east and west in Berlin.Historians have looked at the Cold War in many different ways over the years. Here are some statements about the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s from modern school textbooks:""Between 1949 and 1963, the Cold War developed with a series of major crises.""""When Stalin died in 1953, there was a slight improvement in relations between East and West, although problems still existed."""" Khrushchev's blustering vigour, his love of travel and of argument and his willingness to take risks left their mark on these years.""""The wall not only divided Berlin. Over the following years, it became a symbol of division - the division of Germany, the division of Europe, the division of communist East and democratic West. The Communists presented the wall as being a protective shell. The West presented it as a prison wall.""""The Americans believed that it was their duty, and necessary to US security, to resist the expansion of communism wherever it occurred. During the 1960s, this led them to the brink of nuclear war."""" It soon became clear to the capitalist states that, despite co-existence, Khrushchev was determined to show that communism could compete with, and beat, the West.""""The Cold War was a mixture of a religious crusade in favour of one ideology or the other and the most ruthless power politics.""To help you revise this section, take each statement in turn and think about what it is claiming about theof the Cold War during these years. Then, using the Revision Bites in this topic, decide whether you agree or disagree with it.Suggests that the Cold War was a real war, only with a series of crises (instead of a series of battles).Suggests that Stalin was to blame for many Cold War tensions, for example through his use of 'salami' tactics (the elimination of opposition to Communism in eastern Europe piece by piece), and as a result of his actions in Poland. Consequently the Cold War waned after his death in 1953.Suggests that Khrushchev's actions and character were a cause of the confrontations (eg the Kitchen debate and Cuba).Says that the Berlin Wall was a symbol of the Cold War, but also suggests that the Cold War was a result of mutual misunderstandings - each side had its own take on what was happening (eg The Communists presented the wall as being a protective shell. The West presented it as a prison wall).Suggests that the Cold War was the USA's fault, because it tried to resist communism (eg Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, Korea, NSC68, U2 incident).Suggests that the Cold War was the result of the USSR's attempt to defeat capitalism (eg Warsaw Pact, Hungary, Cuban missile bases).Suggests that the Cold War was a war of ideas - a war of different political religions (the ideological differences between America and Russia).As part of your revision, think about thethere was a thaw in the Cold War after 1953.features characterised the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s."

Now a new exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London, England, gives evidence for both sides.""Everything says this dinosaur lived on dead meat,"" said American scientist Jack Horner. He helped the museum prepare for the exhibit.Scientists once believed that T. rex was a fast runner. But recent studies have shown that might not be true. Horner says thatwas not fast enough to catch other dinosaurs. He also says that its arms were too small to use for grabbing prey. Prey is an animal hunted by another animal for food.means ""tyrant lizard king."" Tyrant means ""cruel ruler.""Other scientists don't agree with Horner. They argue thatwasn't fast, they say, it could have hunted slower dinosaurs. Scientists also say thatdid not need its arms to hunt. Animals without arms, such as sharks and snakes, hunt prey.have been both a hunter and a scavenger? One museum official thinks ""the truth lies somewhere in the middle."" It is up to visitors to think like scientists and decide for themselves. What do you think?Why is it important to study both sides of an argument?measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."

That spells trouble for polar bears and other animals.Polar bears are in danger as the Arctic heats up.Polar bears spend much of their time on sea ice.The heat is on for animals living in the Arctic. That is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In a recent report, scientists warn that the Arctic is warming up. They say that in 2005, the Arctic had the smallest amount of ice it has had in more than 100 years.Polar bears and other animals that depend on sea ice are in danger, say scientists. Polar bears travel across the ice to hunt for seals. With less sea ice, polar bears have trouble finding food and surviving. ""If the sea ice were to disappear, animals that depend on the ice would face a greater risk of extinction,"" scientist Ted Scambos toldfor the melting Arctic ice. Global warming is the gradual rise in Earth’s temperature.Some scientists say people contribute to global warming. When people drive cars and use electricity, they burnsuch as coal, oil, and natural gas. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun. That can cause a rise in temperature around the world.""Things are changing very fast near the North Pole. Eventually, that is going to affect the rest of the world as well,"" says Scambos. ""This is going to be one of the great challenges facing people in the next 50 to 100 years.""Earth is made up of many different habitats. The Arctic is a cold, windy environment called the. Snow and ice cover the ground for most of the year. No trees grow there because the soil is too cold. However, some plants grow in the tundra.What are some ways people can reduce their need for fossil fuels?measures published under license with MetaMetrics, Inc.All trademarks and logos are property of Weekly Reader Corporation."
